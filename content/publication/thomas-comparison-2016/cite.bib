 abstract = {Purpose: To investigate (a) the relationships between maximal isometric strength, vertical jump (VJ), sprint speed, and change of direction speed (CODS) in academy netball players, and (b) determine whether players who have high performance in isometric strength testing would demonstrate superior performance in VJ, sprint speed, and CODS measures. Methods: Twenty-six young female netball players (age = 16.1 ± 1.2 years; height = 173.9 ± 5.7 cm; body mass = 66.0 ± 7.2 kg;) from a regional netball academy performed isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), 10-m sprints, and CODS (505). Results: Isometric mid-thigh pull measures displayed moderate-to-strong correlations with sprint and CODS performance (r = -.41 to -.66). The VJs, which included SJ and CMJ demonstrated strong correlations with 10-m sprint times (r = -.60 to -.65; p \textless 0.01) and CODS (r = -.60 to -.71; p = .01). Stronger players displayed significantly faster sprint (ES = 1.1 - 1.2) and CODS times (ES = 1.2 - 1.7), and greater VJ height (ES = 0.9 to 1.0) compared to the weaker players. Conclusions: The results of this study illustrate the importance of developing high levels of lower-body strength to enhance VJ, sprint, and CODS performance in youth netball players, with stronger athletes demonstrating superior VJ, sprint, and CODS performances.},
