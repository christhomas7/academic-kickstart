abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate (a) the relationships between maximal isometric
  strength, vertical jump (VJ), sprint speed, and change of direction speed (CODS)
  in academy netball players, and (b) determine whether players who have high performance
  in isometric strength testing would demonstrate superior performance in VJ, sprint
  speed, and CODS measures. Methods: Twenty-six young female netball players (age
  = 16.1 ± 1.2 years; height = 173.9 ± 5.7 cm; body mass = 66.0 ± 7.2 kg;) from a
  regional netball academy performed isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), squat jumps
  (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), 10-m sprints, and CODS (505). Results: Isometric
  mid-thigh pull measures displayed moderate-to-strong correlations with sprint and
  CODS performance (r = -.41 to -.66). The VJs, which included SJ and CMJ demonstrated
  strong correlations with 10-m sprint times (r = -.60 to -.65; p textless 0.01) and
  CODS (r = -.60 to -.71; p = .01). Stronger players displayed significantly faster
  sprint (ES = 1.1 - 1.2) and CODS times (ES = 1.2 - 1.7), and greater VJ height (ES
  = 0.9 to 1.0) compared to the weaker players. Conclusions: The results of this study
  illustrate the importance of developing high levels of lower-body strength to enhance
  VJ, sprint, and CODS performance in youth netball players, with stronger athletes
  demonstrating superior VJ, sprint, and CODS performances.'
