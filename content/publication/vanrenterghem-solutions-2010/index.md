abstract: "While studying detailed lower limb mechanics of dynamic sports manoeuvres like side cutting it is often desirable but practically difﬁcult to directly measure velocity proﬁles of the whole-body centre of mass (CoM). In the current study, representations of CoM, either based on a single marker placed on the pelvis or thorax, or based on segment kinematics of lower limbs with or without inclusion of trunk, were evaluated against whole-body CoM representation. Using the 95% limits of agreement method for comparison of two methods, strongest agreement was found between velocity of whole-body CoM and CoM representation based on lower limbs with the addition of the trunk. The CoM representation based on lower limbs only showed weaker agreement, but this representation was still markedly superior to single marker representations."
