 abstract = {The aims of this study were to compare isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) peak force (PF), time-specific force values (100-, 150- and 200 ms), rate of force development (RFD) at pre-determined time bands (0-100, 0-150 and 0-200 ms) and net forces between two commonly adopted hip joint angles (145˚[hip145] and 175˚[hip175]) with a 145˚ standardised knee angle. Twenty-eight collegiate athletes (age: 21.7 ± 1.5 years, height: 1.75 ± 0.08 m, mass: 81.5 ± 8.4 kg) performed two IMTP trials at each hip joint angle in a randomised counterbalanced order. A subgroup (n=10) performed the IMTP testing seven days later to establish between-session reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) demonstrated high within-session reliability and acceptable variability for all IMTP kinetics at each posture (ICC ≥ 0.86, CV ≤ 13.7%) excluding hip175 RFD 0-100 ms and net force at 100 ms which demonstrated greater variability (CV = 18.1-18.5%). High-between session reliability and acceptable variability were observed for all IMTP kinetics at each posture (ICC = 0.72-0.97, CV = 4.5-12.8%), excluding RFD 0-100 ms which demonstrated greater variability for both postures. Hip145 produced significantly greater time-specific force values (p ≤ 0.025, g = 0.25-0.28), RFD at pre-determined time bands (p ≤ 0.001, g = 0.59-0.78) and net forces (p ≤ 0.001, g = 0.57-0.74) compared to hip175. Trivial non-significant differences were demonstrated between postures for PF and force at 100 ms (p \textgreater 0.05, g ≤ 0.14). Significantly greater body weights (weighing period force) were observed with hip175 compared to hip145 (p \textless 0.001, g = 0.74). Coaches should consider administering a hip145 for IMTP testing as greater IMTP kinetics and lower levels of pre-tension during the weighing period are achieved with this posture.},
