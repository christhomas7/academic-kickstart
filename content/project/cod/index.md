Change of direction is a fundamental physical quality of field- and court-based sports, and also forms the mechanical and physical basis underpinning agility. This research theme focusses on the assessment and monitoring of biomechanical and neuromuscular performance indices and risk factors which are widely believed to be modifiable.

By challenging athletes performance during dynamic tasks such as sidestepping, cutting and turning, and combining this with robust methods and novel techniques we establish new insights into change of direction performance and risk of injury.
