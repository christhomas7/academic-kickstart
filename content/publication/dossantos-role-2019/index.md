abstract: MOST CHANGE OF DIRECTION BIOMECHANICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND CURRENT TECHNIQUE
  GUIDELINES FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF THE FINAL FOOT CONTACT. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT
  PENULTIMATE FOOT CONTACT BRAKING CHARACTERISTICS PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN DECELERATION
  BEFORE DIRECTIONAL CHANGES ≥60°; AND CAN THEREFORE, BE DESCRIBED AS A “PREPARATORY
  STEP.” IN THIS REVIEW, WE EXAMINE THE ROLE OF THE PENULTIMATE FOOT CONTACT ON CHANGE
  OF DIRECTION PERFORMANCE AND BIOMECHANICAL INJURY RISK FACTORS, AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL
  GUIDELINES FOR COACHING THE “PREPARATORY STEP” DURING CHANGE OF DIRECTION, TO ENHANCE
  PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE RISK OF INJURY. A VIDEO ABSTRACT DESCRIBING THIS ARTICLE
  CAN BE FOUND IN SUPPLEMENTAL DIGITAL CONTENT 1 (SEE VIDEO, HTTP://LINKS.LWW.COM/SCJ/A240).
