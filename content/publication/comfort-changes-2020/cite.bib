Changes in early and maximal isometric force production in response to moderate- and high-load strength and power training. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000, 2020—The aims of this study were to determine the changes in early (50-, 100-, 150-, 200-, 250 ms) and maximal isometric force production, in response to a 4-week period of moderate-load resistance training (60–82.5% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]), followed by a 4-week period of high-load (80–90% 1RM) resistance training. Thirty-four subjects (age 19.5 ± 2.8 years; height 1.72 ± 0.08 m; body mass 69.9 ± 11.4 kg; maximal power clean 0.92 ± 0.03 kg·kg−1) participated in this study. Only trivial-to-moderate (0.2–2.7%, d = 0.00–0.88) and nonsignificant (p \textgreater 0.05) changes in early isometric force production were observed in response to the moderate-load training period, whereas very large (9.2–14.6%, d = 2.71–4.16), significant (p ≤ 0.001) increases in early isometric force production were observed in response to high-load training. In contrast, there was a very large, significant increase in peak force (PF) across the moderate-load phase (7.7 ± 11.8%, d = 2.02, p = 0.003), but only a moderate significant increase in PF (3.8 ± 10.6%, d = 1.16, p = 0.001) across the high-load phase. The results of this study indicate that high-load multijoint resistance training, that follows moderate-load training, results in superior increases in early multi-joint force production, compared with the changes observed after moderate-load resistance training.},
