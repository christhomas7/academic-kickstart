abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the between-session reliability
  of common strength- and power-related measures in adolescent athletes. Seventeen
  adolescent athletes (males: n = 8: age 17.1 ± 2.2 years; height 175.6 ± 3.5 cm;
  mass 80.2 ± 3.6 kg; females: n = 9; age 16.9 ± 2.6 years; height 178.5 ± 4.3 cm;
  mass 71.5 ± 4.5 kg) participated in this study. Isokinetic dynamometry, isometric
  mid-thigh pull (IMTP), countermovement jump (CMJ), and horizontal jumps (standing
  broad jump (SBJ) and single-leg hop (SLH)) were each performed twice on separate
  days, seven days apart. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient
  (ICC), coefficient of variation (%CV), standard error of measurement (SEM), and
  smallest detectable difference (SDD). Intraclass correlation coefficients and CV
  demonstrated acceptable between-session reliability for all measures (ICC textgreater
  0.63; CV 7% CMJ height, textgreater8% SLH distance, textgreater10% in peak isometric
  force, and textgreater5% in isokinetic peak torques should be considered meaningful,
  when assessing adolescent athletes.'
