abstract: 'Cutting actions are important maneuvers in multidirectional sport and are
  also key actions associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury;
  however, it is important to note that three primary cutting techniques have been
  studied within the literature: the side-step, crossover cut, and split-step. These
  cutting techniques demonstrate kinetic and kinematic differences which have distinct
  implications for both performance and potential injury risk. In this review, we
  discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three cutting techniques and provide
  cutting technical guidelines, verbal coaching cues, and change of direction speed
  and agility programming recommendations to enhance performance and promote safer
  mechanics.'
