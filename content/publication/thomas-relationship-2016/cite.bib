 abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to determine the relationships between isometric strength, sprint, and change of direction speed (CODS) performance in academy cricketers. Design and Methods: Eighteen male academy cricketers (mean ± SD; age = 17.1 ± 0.7 years; height = 175.8 ± 6.1 cm; mass = 71.7 ± 11.3 kg) performed tests of bilateral and unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), sprint, and change of direction speed (CODS) across two separate testing sessions. Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with relative peak force (PF [N • kgˉ¹]) determined for bilateral stance (IMTP PF), left leg (IMTP L PF), and right leg (IMTP R PF). Sprint and CODS performances was measured using 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint performance, and traditional 505 (505) and modified 505 (505mod) tests. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and CODS performances) were analysed using Pearson's product – moment correlation. Results: Results suggest that IMTP R PF displayed the strongest relationships with sprint performance (r = − 0.49 to − 0.52). Times to complete 505 CODS were significantly correlated with bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.47 to − 0.65), whereas modified 505mod CODS performance demonstrated no correlation to either bilateral or unilateral stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.31 to − 0.44). Conclusions: There are no significant relationships between bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF and 505mod CODS. Furthermore, there are no significant relationships between bilateral stance IMTP PF and sprint performance. However, this study identified bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF to relate to 505 CODS.},
