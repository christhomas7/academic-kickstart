abstract: "The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of between limb asymmetries\
  \ in IMTP force-time characteristics on change of direction speed (CODS). Twenty\
  \ multisport collegiate athletes (mean ± SD: age: 21.0 ± 1.9 years; mass: 78.7 ±\
  \ 8.9 kg; height: 1.77 ± 0.04 m) performed three unilateral stance IMTP trials per\
  \ limb and three modified 505 CODS trials each side to establish imbalances between\
  \ left and right, and dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) limbs. Limb dominance was\
  \ defined as the limb that produced the highest isometric force-time value or faster\
  \ CODS performance. Paired sample t-tests and Hedges' g effect sizes revealed no\
  \ significant differences in IMTP force-time characteristics and CODS performance\
  \ between left and right limbs (p textgreater 0.05, g ≤ 0.37). However, significant\
  \ differences were observed between D and ND limbs for all IMTP force-time characteristics\
  \ and CODS performance (p textless 0.001, g = 0.39-0.73). No significant correlations\
  \ were observed between IMTP asymmetries and CODS asymmetry (p ≥ 0.380, r ≤ -0.35),\
  \ and no significant differences were observed in CODS performance between athletes\
  \ of lesser and greater IMTP asymmetries (p ≥ 0.10, g ≤ 0.76). Poor percentage agreements\
  \ (40-60%) between like for like classifications of asymmetry (i.e. either both\
  \ asymmetrical or both balanced) for CODS and IMTP force-time characteristics were\
  \ demonstrated. Asymmetries in IMTP force-time characteristics and CODS performance\
  \ were present; however, greater IMTP asymmetries had no detrimental impact on CODS\
  \ performance and did not equate to greater asymmetries in CODS performance. Therefore,\
  \ collegiate athletes with asymmetries within the range reported within this study\
  \ (≤13%) should not experience detriments to CODS or faster performance from that\
  \ limb during 180° turns."
