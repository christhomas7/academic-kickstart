abstract: "Comfort, P, Jones, PA, Thomas, C, Dos'Santos, T, McMahon, JJ, and Suchomel,\
  \ TJ. Changes in early and maximal isometric force production in response to moderate-\
  \ and high-load strength and power training. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000,\
  \ 2020—The aims of this study were to determine the changes in early (50-, 100-,\
  \ 150-, 200-, 250 ms) and maximal isometric force production, in response to a 4-week\
  \ period of moderate-load resistance training (60–82.5% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]),\
  \ followed by a 4-week period of high-load (80–90% 1RM) resistance training. Thirty-four\
  \ subjects (age 19.5 ± 2.8 years; height 1.72 ± 0.08 m; body mass 69.9 ± 11.4 kg;\
  \ maximal power clean 0.92 ± 0.03 kg·kg−1) participated in this study. Only trivial-to-moderate\
  \ (0.2–2.7%, d = 0.00–0.88) and nonsignificant (p textgreater 0.05) changes in early\
  \ isometric force production were observed in response to the moderate-load training\
  \ period, whereas very large (9.2–14.6%, d = 2.71–4.16), significant (p ≤ 0.001)\
  \ increases in early isometric force production were observed in response to high-load\
  \ training. In contrast, there was a very large, significant increase in peak force\
  \ (PF) across the moderate-load phase (7.7 ± 11.8%, d = 2.02, p = 0.003), but only\
  \ a moderate significant increase in PF (3.8 ± 10.6%, d = 1.16, p = 0.001) across\
  \ the high-load phase. The results of this study indicate that high-load multijoint\
  \ resistance training, that follows moderate-load training, results in superior\
  \ increases in early multi-joint force production, compared with the changes observed\
  \ after moderate-load resistance training."
