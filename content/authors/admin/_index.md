I’m an applied Sport Scientist with an interest in Sports Biomechanics and Strength & Conditioning, and a passion for sciences & innovation. I have over 10 years of experience working in team and individual sports. 

I’m currently a Senior Biomechanist at an elite football academy. My role is to oversee all football biomechanics performance monitoring and research projects from creation to execution. I also collaborate on innovation initiatives across the academy.
