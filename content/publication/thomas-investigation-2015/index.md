abstract: Research has demonstrated a clear relationship between dynamic strength
  and vertical jump performance; however, the relationship of isometric strength and
  vertical jump performance has been studied less extensively. The aim of this study
  was to determine the relationship between isometric strength and performance during
  the squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ). Twenty-two male collegiate athletes
  (mean ± SD; age = 21.3 ± 2.9 years; height = 175.63 ± 8.23 cm; body mass = 78.06
  ± 10.77 kg) performed isometric mid-thigh pulls (IMTP) to assess isometric peak
  force (IPF), maximum rate of force development (mRFD) and impulse (I100, I200, and
  I300). Force time data, collected during the vertical jumps, was used to calculate
  peak velocity (PV), peak force (PF), peak power (PP), and jump height. Absolute
  IMTP measures of IMP showed the strongest correlations with VJ PF(r = 0.43 - 0.64,
  p ≤ 0.05), and VJ PP (r = 0.38 - 0.60, p ≤ 0.05). No statistical difference was
  observed in CMJ height (0.33 ± 0.05 m vs. 0.36 ± 0.05 m; p = 0.19; ES = -0.29) and
  SJ height performance (0.29 ± 0.06 m vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 m vs.; p = 0.14; ES = -0.34)
  when comparing stronger to weaker athletes. The results of this study illustrate
  that absolute IPF and IMP are related to VJ PF and PP, but not VJ height. As stronger
  athletes did not jump higher than weaker athletes, dynamic strength tests may be
  more practical methods of assessing the relationships between relative strength
  levels and dynamic performance in collegiate athletes.
