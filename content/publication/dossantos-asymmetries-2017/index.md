abstract: 'Objectives: To determine the impact of between limb asymmetries in hop
  performance on change of direction speed (CODS). Design and Methods: Twenty-two
  multisport collegiate athletes (mean ± SD; age: 21.8 ± 3.4 years, height: 178.1
  ± 6.7 cm, mass: 73.5 ± 7.1kg) performed three single and triple horizontal hops
  for distance per limb, followed by three modified 505 and 90˚cut CODS trials each
  side to establish imbalances between right and left, and dominant (D) and non-dominant
  (ND) limbs. Limb dominance was defined as the limb that produced the furthest hop
  or faster CODS performance. Results: Paired sample t-tests revealed no significant
  differences in hop performance and CODS performance between right and left limbs
  (p textgreater 0.05, g ≤ 0.11), however, significant differences were observed when
  comparing D and ND limbs (p textless 0.001, g = 0.46-0.61). No significant correlations
  were observed between hop imbalance and CODS performance (p textgreater 0.05, r
  ≤ 0.35). Low agreements (32-55%) were demonstrated between like for like identifications
  of asymmetry for CODS and hop performance. Conclusions: Imbalances in hop and CODS
  were present; however, greater hop imbalances were not detrimental to CODS. Furthermore,
  the D limb for hopping did not necessarily correspond to faster performance from
  that limb during 180˚turns180˚turns and 90˚cuts90˚cuts (plant foot). Collegiate
  male multi-sport athletes with imbalances within the range reported within this
  study (≤ 15%) should not experience associated CODS detriments.'
