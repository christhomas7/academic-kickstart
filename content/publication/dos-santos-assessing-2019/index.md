abstract: "The aims of this study were to quantify asymmetries in change of direction\
  \ (COD) performance via completion time and COD deficit, and determine its influence\
  \ on asymmetry profiling of COD ability. A secondary aim was to evaluate the relationship\
  \ between linear speed, 505 time and COD deficit. Forty-three youth netball athletes\
  \ (age: 15.4 ± 1.1 years, height: 1.71 ± 0.06 m, mass: 63.3 ± 6.6 kg) performed\
  \ the 505 for both left and right limbs and a 10 m sprint test. Asymmetries in 505\
  \ completion time and COD deficit were quantified for dominant (D) (faster) and\
  \ non-dominant (ND) (slower) directions. Paired sample t-tests revealed significant\
  \ differences between D and ND directions for 505 time and COD deficit (p textless\
  \ 0.0001, g = -0.53 to -0.60). Substantially greater asymmetries for COD deficit\
  \ were observed compared to 505 time (p textless 0.0001, g = 1.03). Only two subjects\
  \ displayed an asymmetry ≥10% based on 505 times. Conversely, based on COD deficit,\
  \ 21 subjects demonstrated asymmetries ≥10%. Large significant associations were\
  \ observed between 505 time and COD deficit (r = 0.500-0.593, p ≤ 0.002). Large\
  \ significant inverse associations were demonstrated between 10 m sprint time and\
  \ COD deficit (r = -0.539 to -0.633, p ≤ 0.001) indicating faster athletes had longer\
  \ COD deficits. Nine subjects were classified differently for COD ability when comparing\
  \ standardized scores for 505 time versus COD deficit. Quantification of asymmetries\
  \ in COD ability should be based on COD deficits; inspection of 505 times only could\
  \ lead to misinterpretations of an athlete's COD symmetry and COD ability. Faster\
  \ youth netball athletes demonstrate longer COD deficits, thus, researchers and\
  \ practitioners are encouraged to improve their youth netball athletes' ability\
  \ to rapidly decelerate, change direction and reaccelerate from 180° turns."
