abstract: 'Changes of direction (CODs) are key manoeuvres linked to decisive moments
  in sport and are also key actions associated with lower limb injuries. During sport
  athletes perform a diverse range of CODs, from various approach velocities and angles,
  thus the ability to change direction safely and quickly is of great interest. To
  our knowledge, a comprehensive review examining the influence of angle and velocity
  on change of direction (COD) biomechanics does not exist. Findings of previous research
  indicate the biomechanical demands of CODs are ‘angle’ and ‘velocity’ dependent
  and are both critical factors that affect the technical execution of directional
  changes, deceleration and reacceleration requirements, knee joint loading, and lower
  limb muscle activity. Thus, these two factors regulate the progression and regression
  in COD intensity. Specifically, faster and sharper CODs elevate the relative risk
  of injury due to the greater associative knee joint loading; however, faster and
  sharper directional changes are key manoeuvres for successful performance in multidirectional
  sport, which subsequently creates a ‘performance-injury conflict’ for practitioners
  and athletes. This conflict, however, may be mediated by an athlete’s physical capacity
  (i.e. ability to rapidly produce force and neuromuscular control). Furthermore,
  an ‘angle-velocity trade-off’ exists during CODs, whereby faster approaches compromise
  the execution of the intended COD; this is influenced by an athlete’s physical capacity.
  Therefore, practitioners and researchers should acknowledge and understand the implications
  of angle and velocity on COD biomechanics when: (1) interpreting biomechanical research;
  (2) coaching COD technique; (3) designing and prescribing COD training and injury
  reduction programs; (4) conditioning athletes to tolerate the physical demands of
  directional changes; (5) screening COD technique; and (6) progressing and regressing
  COD intensity, specifically when working with novice or previously injured athletes
  rehabilitating from an injury.'
