abstract: 'Objective: To critically evaluate the effect of limb dominance on change
  of direction (COD) biomechanics associated with increased ACL injury-risk. Methods:
  A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS
  databases. Studies that compared COD biomechanics (lower-limb/whole-body kinetics/kinematics)
  between limbs, contained an approach run, and included physically active participants
  were included. Results: Of the 456 articles identified, six were included. All studies
  investigated a cutting action, while the majority defined limb dominance as the
  preferred kicking limb, whereas one study defined limb dominance as preferred push-off
  cutting limb. Conflicting observations were found, with one study indicating the
  non-dominant and one study indicating the dominant limb displayed biomechanical
  deficits associated with increased non-contact ACL injury-risk during COD. Conversely,
  the remaining studies demonstrated no significant or substantial differences in
  COD biomechanics between limbs. Conclusions: Female soccer players, male rugby players,
  and female handball players exhibit subtle side-to-side differences when performing
  cutting manoeuvres. However, the limb displaying high-risk mechanics is inconsistent
  within and between studies and populations. Thus, it remains inconclusive for COD
  that limb dominance is an ACL injury-risk factor and whether a particular limb is
  of heightened injury-risk. Level of evidence: Level 2, Systematic review.'
