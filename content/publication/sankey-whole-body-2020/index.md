abstract: "Control of the centre of mass (CoM) whilst minimising the use of unnecessary movements is imperative for successful performance of dynamic sports tasks, and may indicate the condition of whole-body dynamic stability. The aims of this study were to express movement strategies that represent whole-body dynamic stability, and to explore their association with potentially injurious joint mechanics and side cutting performance. Twenty recreational soccer players completed 45° unanticipated side cutting. Five distinct whole-body dynamic stability movement strategies were identiﬁed, based on factors that inﬂuence the medial ground reaction force (GRF) vector during ground contact in the side cutting manoeuvre. Using Statistical Parametric Mapping, the movement strategies were linearly regressed against selected performance outcomes and peak knee abduction moment (peak KAM). Signiﬁcant relationships were found between each movement strategy and at least one selected performance outcome or peak KAM. Our results suggest excessive medial GRFs were generated through sagittal plane movement strategies, and despite being beneﬁcial for performance aspects, poor sagittal plane efﬁciency may destabilise control of the CoM. Frontal plane hip acceleration is the key non-sagittal plane movement strategy used in a corrective capacity to moderate excessive medial forces. However, whilst this movement strategy offered a way to retrieve control of the CoM, mitigating reduced whole-body dynamic stability, it also coincided with increased peak KAM. Overall, whole-body dynamic stability movement strategies helped explain the delicate interplay between the mechanics of changing direction and undesirable joint moments, providing insights that might support development of future intervention strategies."
