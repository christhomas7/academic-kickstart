abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in countermovement
  jump peak force (CMJ-PF), isometric mid-thigh pull peak force (IMTP-PF), and resultant
  dynamic strength index (DSI) values between team-sport athletes. One hundred and
  fifteen male and female team-sport athletes performed the CMJ and IMTP to determine
  peak force (CMJ-PF and IMTP-PF, respectively). Statistically and practically significant
  differences (p textless 0.050; d = 0.49–1.32) in CMJ-PF were evident between teams.
  Specifically, the greatest CMJ-PFs were produced by the male cricket players and
  were followed in order by the male basketball, male soccer, female netball, female
  cricket, and female soccer players. Statistically and practically significant differences
  (p textless 0.045; d = 0.64–1.78) in IMTP-PF existed among sports teams, with the
  greatest IMTP-PFs were produced by the male soccer players and were followed in
  order by the male cricket, male basketball, female netball, female soccer, and female
  cricket players. Statistically and practically significant differences (p textless
  0.050; d = 0.92–1.44) in DSI were found between teams. These findings demonstrate
  that CMJ-PF, IMTP-PF, and DSI differ between sports teams and provide normative
  data for ballistic and isometric PF measures. Strength and conditioning coaches
  should consider relative changes in CMJ-PF and IMTP-PF when assessing DSI ratios.
