abstract: "Dos'Santos, T, McBurnie, A, Thomas, C, Comfort, P, and Jones, PA. Biomechanical\
  \ determinants of the modified and traditional 505 change of direction speed test.\
  \ J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to investigate\
  \ the whole-body biomechanical determinants of 180° change of direction (COD) performance.\
  \ Sixty-one male athletes (age: 20.7 ± 3.8 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m, mass: 74.7\
  \ ± 10.0 kg) from multiple sports (soccer, rugby, and cricket) completed 6 trials\
  \ of the modified and traditional 505 on their right leg, whereby 3D motion and\
  \ ground reaction force data were collected during the COD. Pearson's and Spearman's\
  \ correlations were used to explore the relationships between biomechanical variables\
  \ and COD completion time. Independent t-tests and Hedges' g effect sizes were conducted\
  \ between faster (top 20) and slower (bottom 20) performers to explore differences\
  \ in biomechanical variables. Key kinetic and kinematic differences were demonstrated\
  \ between faster and slower performers with statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05)\
  \ and meaningful differences (g = 0.56-2.70) observed. Faster COD performers displayed\
  \ greater peak and mean horizontal propulsive forces (PF) in shorter ground contact\
  \ times, more horizontally orientated peak resultant braking and PFs, greater horizontal\
  \ to vertical mean and peak braking and PF ratios, greater approach velocities,\
  \ and displayed greater reductions in velocity over key instances of the COD. In\
  \ addition, faster performers displayed greater penultimate foot contact (PFC) hip,\
  \ knee, and ankle dorsi-flexion angles, greater medial trunk lean, and greater internal\
  \ pelvic and foot rotation. These aforementioned variables were also moderately\
  \ to very largely (r or ρ = 0.317-0.795, p ≤ 0.013) associated with faster COD performance.\
  \ Consequently, practitioners should focus not only on developing their athletes'\
  \ ability to express force rapidly, but also develop their technical ability to\
  \ apply force horizontally. In addition, practitioners should consider coaching\
  \ a 180° turning strategy that emphasizes high PFC triple flexion for center of\
  \ mass lowering while also encouraging whole-body rotation to effectively align\
  \ the body toward the exit for faster performance."
