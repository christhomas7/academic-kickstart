abstract: 'The aim of the study was to determine the between-session reliability of
  isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) kinetics and maximal weight lifted during the power
  clean (PC) in male youth soccer players, and to identify the smallest detectable
  differences between sessions. Thirteen male youth soccer players (age: 16.7 ± 0.5
  years, height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m, mass: 70.5 ± 9.4 kg) performed three IMTP trials,
  while only ten soccer players performed maximal power cleans. These were performed
  twice, separated by 48 hours to examine the between-session reliability. Intraclass
  correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) demonstrated high
  levels of within-session (ICC = 0.84-0.98, CV = 4.05-10.00%) and between-session
  reliability (ICC = 0.86-0.96, CV = 3.76-7.87%) for IMTP kinetics (peak force and
  time-specific force values 30-250 ms) and maximal PC (ICC = 0.96, CV = 3.23%), all
  meeting minimum acceptable reliability criteria. No significant differences (ptextgreater0.05,
  effect size ≤0.22) were revealed between sessions for IMTP kinetics and maximal
  PC performance. Strength and conditioning coaches and practitioners should consider
  changes of textgreater6.04% in maximal PC and changes in IMTP kinetics of textgreater14.31%
  in force at 30 ms, textgreater 14.73% in force at 50 ms, textgreater12.36% in force
  at 90 ms, textgreater12.37% in force at 100 ms, textgreater14.51% in force at 150
  ms, textgreater11.71% in force at 200 ms, textgreater7.23% in force at 250 ms and
  textgreater8.50% in absolute peak force as meaningful improvements in male youth
  soccer players. Decrements in the IMTP kinetics greater than aforementioned values
  could possibly be used as an indicator of neuromuscular fatigue and preparedness
  for training or competition.'
