abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between isometric
  mid-thigh pull (IMTP) force-time characteristics (peak force and time-specific force
  vales (100–250 ms)) and dynamic performance and compare dynamic performance between
  stronger and weaker athletes. Forty-three athletes from different sports (rowing,
  soccer, bicycle motocross, and hockey) performed three trials of the squat jump
  (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and IMTP, and performed a one repetition maximum
  power clean (PC). Reactive strength index modified (RSImod) was also calculated
  from the CMJ. Statistically significant large correlations between IMTP force-time
  characteristics and PC (ρ = 0.569–0.674, p textless 0.001), and moderate correlations
  between IMTP force-time characteristics (excluding force at 100 ms) and RSImod (ρ
  = 0.389–0.449, p = 0.013–0.050) were observed. Only force at 250 ms demonstrated
  a statistically significant moderate correlation with CMJ height (ρ = 0.346, p =
  0.016) and no statistically significant associations were observed between IMTP
  force-time characteristics and SJ height. Stronger athletes (top 10) demonstrated
  statistically significantly greater CMJ heights, RSImods, and PCs (p ≤ 0.004, g
  = 1.32–1.89) compared to weaker (bottom 10) athletes, but no differences in SJ height
  were observed (p = 0.871, g = 0.06). These findings highlight that the ability to
  apply rapidly high levels of force in short time intervals is integral for PC, CMJ
  height, and reactive strength.
