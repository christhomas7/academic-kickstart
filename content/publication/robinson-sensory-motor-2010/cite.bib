 abstract = {Cervical spinal lesions at C6 result in paralysis of the triceps brachii while leaving deltoid and elbow Xexor function intact. We examined the spatial–temporal characteristics of goal-directed aiming movements performed by C6 tetraplegics who had undergone musculotendinous transfer surgery in which the posterior deltoid replaces the triceps as the elbow extensor. On some trials, liquid crystal goggles were used to eliminate vision of the limb and target upon movement initiation. Although tetraplegic participants achieved the same degree of movement accuracy/ consistency as control participants, their movement times were longer regardless of whether the movements were made away from (elbow extension) or towards the body (elbow Xexion). Longer movement times were related to lower peak velocities, and not the symmetry of the aiming proWles. The tetraplegic participants were no more dependent on visual feedback for limb regulation than control participants. Although the characteristics of the movement trajectories were surprisingly similar, in both vision conditions, tetraplegics required more real and proportional time to reduce spatial variability in the limb’s trajectory for elbow extensions. Our results indicate that the sensorimotor system is adaptable and that the representations governing limb control are not muscle speciWc.},
