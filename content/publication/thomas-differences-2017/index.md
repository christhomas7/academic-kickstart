abstract: The countermovement jump (CMJ) and isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) are commonly
  used to compare one’s force capacity during dynamic and isometric assessments, respectively.
  However, little research has investigated the influence of maximum isometric strength
  on drop-jump (DJ) performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore
  differences in CMJ and DJ force-time characteristics between stronger and weaker
  adolescent male basketball players. Sixteen adolescent male basketball players performed
  the IMTP to assess measures of peak force (IMTP PF), whereas CMJ and DJ calculated
  a range of kinetic and kinematic variables. Peak concentric force (CMJ-PF) in the
  CMJ was greater for stronger players (d = 1.99). However, no differences in DJ force-time
  characteristics existed between stronger and weaker players. Future research should
  be undertaken to investigate the role of maximum strength on DJ force-time characteristics
  in adolescent male basketball players. Such studies may help direct the creation
  of athlete training and monitoring programs more effectively to represent accurate
  player profiling.
