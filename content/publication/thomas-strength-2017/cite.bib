 abstract = {THERE IS A LACK OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH INTO THE DEMANDS AND THE SPECIFIC AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED TO OPTIMIZE PERFOR- MANCE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF COMMON INJURIES IN FEMALE NETBALL ATHLETES. NETBALL IS PREDOMINANTLY ANAEROBIC, CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT HIGH-INTENSITY MOVEMENTS THAT REQUIRE HIGH LEVELS OF STRENGTH, POWER, AND LOWER LIMB CONTROL. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH IN THE PREPARATION OF FEMALE NETBALL PLAYERS FOR TRAINING AND COMPETITION. IN THIS REVIEW, WE PRESENT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DEMANDS OF TRAINING AND COMPETITION, COMMON CAUSES OF INJURY, AND STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING TRAINING RECOM- MENDATIONS TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INJURY IN FEMALE NETBALL PLAYERS.},
