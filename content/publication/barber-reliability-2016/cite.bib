 abstract = {To determine the reliability of the 505 change of direction (COD) test performed with both a stationary and flying start. Fifty-two female netball players (age 23.9 ± 5.4 yrs, height 169.9 ± 3.3 cm, body mass 65.2 ± 4.6 kg) performed 6 trials of the 505 COD test, three with a flying start and three with a stationary start, once per week over a four week period, to determine within- and between-session reliability. Testing revealed high within-session reliability for the stationary start (ICC = 0.96-0.97) and for the flying start (ICC = 0.90-0.97). Similarly, both the stationary start (ICC = 0.965) and the flying start demonstrated high reliability (ICC = 0.951) between-sessions, although repeated measures analysis of variance (p\textless0.001) revealed learning effects were found to be present between-sessions for both tests. Performances stabilized on the second day for the static start and on the third day of testing for the flying start. Results suggest that the 505 COD test is a reliable test in female netball players, with either a stationary or flying start. Smallest detectable differences of 3.91% and 3.97% for the stationary start and the flying start, respectively, allow practitioners to interpret whether changes in time taken to complete the 505 COD test reflect genuine improvements in performance or are measurement errors. It is suggested that one day of familiarization testing is performed for the stationary start and two days of familiarization for the flying start, to minimize learning effects.},
