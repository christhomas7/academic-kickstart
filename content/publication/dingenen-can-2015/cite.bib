 abstract = {Background: Less optimal sagittal plane movement patterns are believed to increase knee injury risk in female athletes. To facilitate clinical screening with a user-friendly method, the purpose of the present study was to examine the temporal relationships between two-dimensional measured sagittal plane kinematics and threedimensional joint moments during the double-leg drop vertical jump (DVJ) and single-leg DVJ (SLDVJ).
Methods: Fifty injury-free female athletes were tested. Maximal excursions of hip ﬂexion, knee ﬂexion and ankle dorsiﬂexion were measured through two-dimensional video analysis. Three-dimensional motion and ground reaction forces were recorded to calculate external hip ﬂexion, knee ﬂexion and knee abduction moments during the entire stance phase of DVJ and SLDVJ. One-dimensional statistical parametric mapping was used to examine relationships between peak two-dimensional kinematic variables and three-dimensional moment proﬁles.
Results: Hip ﬂexion was signiﬁcantly related to the hip and knee ﬂexion moment for both tests and knee abduction moment for DVJ during the time frames corresponding with highest three-dimensional moments, while knee ﬂexion was signiﬁcantly related to the hip ﬂexion moment during these time frames. No signiﬁcant relationships were found for ankle dorsiﬂexion with any of the joint moments.
Conclusions: Two-dimensional measured sagittal plane hip ﬂexion angles at the deepest landing position were associated with peak joint moments of the hip and knee during DVJ and SLDVJ, while the amount of knee ﬂexion was only associated with the hip ﬂexion moment. Assessment of knee injury risk with two-dimensional video analysis could beneﬁt from measuring maximal hip ﬂexion, more so than knee ﬂexion.},
