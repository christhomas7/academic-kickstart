abstract: 'Objective: To assess the validity of the cutting movement assessment score
  (CMAS) to estimate the magnitude of peak knee abduction moments (KAM) against three-dimensional
  (3D) motion analysis, while comparing whole-body kinetics and kinematics between
  subjects of low (bottom 33%) and high CMASs (top 33%). Design: Cross-sectional study.
  Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Forty-one participants (soccer, rugby, netball,
  and cricket). Main outcome measures: Association between peak KAM and CMAS during
  a 90° cut. Comparison of 3D whole-body kinetics and kinematics between subjects
  with low (bottom 33%) and high CMASs (top 33%). Results: A very large significant
  relationship (ρ = 0.796, p textless 0.001) between CMAS and peak KAM was observed.
  Subjects with higher CMASs displayed higher-risk cutting postures, including greater
  peak knee abduction angles, internal foot progression angles, and lateral foot plant
  distances (p ≤ 0.032, effect size = 0.83-1.64). Additionally, greater cutting multiplanar
  knee joint loads (knee flexion, internal rotation, and abduction moments) were demonstrated
  by subjects with higher CMASs compared to lower (p ≤ 0.047, effect size = 0.77-2.24).
  Conclusion: The CMAS is a valid qualitative screening tool for evaluating cutting
  movement quality and is therefore a potential method to identify athletes who generate
  high KAMs and \"high-risk\" side-step cutting mechanics.'
