	abstract = {Purpose: To determine the reliability and variability of the Dynamic Strength Index (DSI) calculated from squat-jump (SJ) vs countermovement-jump (CMJ) peak force (PF) and to compare DSI values between methods. Methods: Male youth soccer and rugby league players (N = 27; age 17.2 ± 0.7 y, height 173.9 ± 5.7 cm, body mass 71.1 ± 7.2 kg) performed 3 trials of the SJ, CMJ, and isometric midthigh pull (IMTP) on 2 separate days. DSI was calculated by dividing the PF during each jump by the IMTP PF. Results: DSI-SJ exhibited moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .419) within-session reliability and high variability (percentage coefficient of variation [\%CV] = 15.91) during session 1; however, this improved noticeably during session 2 (ICC = .948, \%CV = 4.03). In contrast, DSI-CMJ showed nearly perfect within-session reliability (ICC = .920–.952) and low variability (\%CV = 3.80–4.57) for both sessions. Moreover, DSI-SJ values demonstrated a small yet significant increase between sessions (P = .01, d = 0.37), whereas only a trivial and nonsignificant increase was observed for DSI-CMJ between sessions (P = .796, d = 0.07). Between-sessions reliability was very high for the DSI-SJ (ICC = .741) and nearly perfect for the DSI-CMJ (ICC = .924). There was no significant or meaningful difference (P = .261, d = 0.12) between DSI-SJ (0.82 ± 0.18) and DSI-CMJ (0.84 ± 0.15). Conclusions: Practitioners should use DSI-CMJ, as it is a more reliable measure than DSI-SJ, although it produces similar ratios.},

Asymmetries in IMTP force-time characteristics and CODS performance were present; however, greater IMTP asymmetries had no detrimental impact on CODS performance and did not equate to greater asymmetries in CODS performance.

	abstract = {Mechanical variables during change of directions for example braking and propulsive forces, impulses and ground contact times (GCT) have been identified as determinants of faster change of direction speed (CODS) performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanical determinants of 180° CODS performance with mechanical characteristic comparisons between faster and slower performers; whilst exploring the role of the penultimate foot contact (PEN) during the change of direction. Forty multidirectional male athletes performed six modified 505 (mod505) trials (3 left and right) and ground reaction forces were collected across the PEN and final foot contact (FINAL) during the change of direction. Pearson's correlation coefficients and co-efficients of determination were used to explore the relationship between mechanical variables and mod505 completion time. Independent T-Tests and Cohen's d effect sizes (ES) were conducted between faster (n=10) and slower (n=10) mod505 performers to explore differences in mechanical variables. Faster CODS performance was associated (p{\textless}0.05) with shorter GCTs (r=0.701-0.757), greater horizontal propulsive forces (r=-0.572 to -0.611), greater horizontal braking forces (HBF) in the PEN (r=-0.337) lower HBF ratios (r=-0.429) and lower FINAL vertical impact forces (VIF) (r=0.449-0.559). Faster athletes demonstrated significantly (p{\textless}0.05, ES=1.08-2.54) shorter FINAL GCTs, produced lower VIF, lower HBF ratios and greater HPF in comparison to slower athletes. These findings suggest that different mechanical properties are required to produce faster CODS performance, with differences in mechanical properties observed between fast and slower performers. Furthermore, applying a greater proportion of braking force during the PEN relative to the FINAL may be advantageous for turning performance.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(12): 3463–3473, 2017—Various thresholds have been used to identify the onset of contraction during isometric midthigh pull (IMTP); however, no agreed onset threshold exists for this assessment. The purpose of this study was to compare relative body weight (BW) and arbitrary onset thresholds to a criterion onset threshold 5 SDs of BW for IMTP force-time variables; force at each threshold, peak force, time-specific force values (100, 150, and 200 ms), and rate of force development (RFD) during 0–100, 0–150, 0–200 ms. Academy rugby league players (n = 9, age: 18.5 ± 0.4 years; height: 1.82 ± 0.09 m; mass: 91.2 ± 13.1 kg) performed 2 IMTP trials on a force platform sampling at 1,000 Hz. The neutral force-time data pool (18 trials) was analyzed with five different thresholds and compared with criterion threshold to determine any variance in force-time variables. Five SDs of BW were significantly lower than 10\% BW and 75 N for threshold force which led to significantly greater time-specific force values at 100 and 150 ms and unacceptable limits of agreements (LOA) for all force-time variables. No significant differences (p {\textgreater} 0.05) were observed between 2.5\% and 5 SDs of BW; and between 5\% and 5 SDs of BW for threshold force and all force-time variables with acceptable LOA. The 5 SDs of BW and 2.5\% BW onset thresholds consistently resulted in the lowest values for threshold force, time-specific force values, and RFD, attributed to a lower onset bias. Therefore, scientists and practitioners are recommended to use a 5 SD of BW onset threshold for time-specific force values and RFD for accurate data because it accounts for signal noise during the weighing period. Subsequently, there is greater certainty that the onset of contraction identifies a true meaningful change in force, in contrast to relative BW thresholds.},

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between isometric strength and performance during the squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ). Twenty-two male collegiate athletes (mean ± SD; age = 21.3 ± 2.9 years; height = 175.63 ± 8.23 cm; body mass = 78.06 ± 10.77 kg) performed isometric mid-thigh pulls (IMTP) to assess isometric peak force (IPF), maximum rate of force development (mRFD) and impulse (I100, I200, and I300). Force time data, collected during the vertical jumps, was used to calculate peak velocity (PV), peak force (PF), peak power (PP), and jump height. Absolute IMTP measures of IMP showed the strongest correlations with VJ PF(r = 0.43 - 0.64, p ≤ 0.05), and VJ PP (r = 0.38 - 0.60, p ≤ 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in CMJ height (0.33 ± 0.05 m vs. 0.36 ± 0.05 m; p = 0.19; ES = -0.29) and SJ height performance (0.29 ± 0.06 m vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 m vs.; p = 0.14; ES = -0.34) when comparing stronger to weaker athletes. The results of this study illustrate that absolute IPF and IMP are related to VJ PF and PP, but not VJ height. As stronger athletes did not jump higher than weaker athletes, dynamic strength tests may be more practical methods of assessing the relationships between relative strength levels and dynamic performance in collegiate athletes.},

Method: Nineteen male college athletes performed the squat jump (SJ) and isometric midthigh pull (IMTP) to determine peak force, on 2 separate days. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error (TE), percentage change in the mean, smallest worthwhile change (SWC), and coefficient of variation (\%CV). Results: Peak force for the SJ was 2137±499 N and 2781±435 N for the IMTP, resulting in a mean DSI of 0.78±0.19. Peak forces in the SJ (ICC=.99, TE=57.22 N, change in mean=0.2\%, SWC=4.7\%, CV=2.6\%) and IMTP (ICC=.95, TE=104.22 N, change in mean=0.5\%, SWC=3.1\%, CV=3.8\%) were considered highly reliable between sessions.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that peak force in the SJ and IMTP are reliable, resulting in a reliable assessment of dynamic-force-production capabilities via the DSI. The DSI may be used to guide individualized training interventions and monitor specific adaptations to training.

Centers performed better during the SLH left leg (p = 0.01; d = 1.0), SJ (p = 0.03; d = 1.1), CMJ (p = 0.01; d = 1.4), 5 m (p = 0.04; d ≥ -0.9) and 10 m sprint (p = 0.01; d = -1.2), 505 left (p ≤ 0.03; d ≥ 1.0), 505 right (p ≤ 0.03; d = 1.3), and cardiorespiratory fitness (p = 0.01; d ≥ 1.2), compared to other positions. No other significant differences were observed. These findings demonstrate that height, body mass and physical characteristics differ between positions in female netball players, and provide normative data for English academy netball players. Strength and conditioning coaches should consider the specific demands on individual positions when training female netball players.},

Design and Methods: Eighteen male academy cricketers (mean ± SD; age = 17.1 ± 0.7 years; height = 175.8 ± 6.1 cm; mass = 71.7 ± 11.3 kg) performed tests of bilateral and unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), sprint, and change of direction speed (CODS) across two separate testing sessions. Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with relative peak force (PF [N • kgˉ¹]) determined for bilateral stance (IMTP PF), left leg (IMTP L PF), and right leg (IMTP R PF). Sprint and CODS performances was measured using 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint performance, and traditional 505 (505) and modified 505 (505mod) tests. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and CODS performances) were analysed using Pearson's product – moment correlation. Results: Results suggest that IMTP R PF displayed the strongest relationships with sprint performance (r = − 0.49 to − 0.52). Times to complete 505 CODS were significantly correlated with bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.47 to − 0.65), whereas modified 505mod CODS performance demonstrated no correlation to either bilateral or unilateral stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.31 to − 0.44). Conclusions: There are no significant relationships between bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF and 505mod CODS. Furthermore, there are no significant relationships between bilateral stance IMTP PF and sprint performance. However, this study identified bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF to relate to 505 CODS.},

Fourteen male semi-professional soccer players performed the 30-15IFT on two occasions, separated by 7 days. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC), to determine any significant difference between testing sessions. Maximal intermittent running velocity (VIFT) demonstrated good reliability (ICC = .80) for between session reliability. The CV was 2.5\% for between session reliability of the 30-15IFT. As the SWC (0.70 km/h) falls within the range in which the individual's true score is likely to lie (1.0 km/h), the usefulness of the VIFT was rated as 'Marginal'. Despite the usefulness of the 30-15IFT being deemed 'Marginal', a change in performance as small as 1.0 km/h (2 stages) in VIFT could be considered substantial or 'real'. This study demonstrates that VIFT in the 30-15IFT is reliable, resulting in a reliable assessment of team-sport specific cardiorespiratory fitness, with changes as small as 1.0 km/h (2 stages) in VIFT considered meaningful.},

Methods: Twenty-six young female netball players (age = 16.1 ± 1.2 years; height = 173.9 ± 5.7 cm; body mass = 66.0 ± 7.2 kg;) from a regional netball academy performed isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), 10-m sprints, and CODS (505). Results: Isometric mid-thigh pull measures displayed moderate-to-strong correlations with sprint and CODS performance (r = -.41 to -.66). The VJs, which included SJ and CMJ demonstrated strong correlations with 10-m sprint times (r = -.60 to -.65; p {\textless} 0.01) and CODS (r = -.60 to -.71; p = .01). Stronger players displayed significantly faster sprint (ES = 1.1 - 1.2) and CODS times (ES = 1.2 - 1.7), and greater VJ height (ES = 0.9 to 1.0) compared to the weaker players. Conclusions: The results of this study illustrate the importance of developing high levels of lower-body strength to enhance VJ, sprint, and CODS performance in youth netball players, with stronger athletes demonstrating superior VJ, sprint, and CODS performances.},

	doi = {10.1007/s40279-018-0968-3},
	abstract = {Changes of direction (CODs) are key manoeuvres linked to decisive moments in sport and are also key actions associated with lower limb injuries. During sport athletes perform a diverse range of CODs, from various approach velocities and angles, thus the ability to change direction safely and quickly is of great interest. To our knowledge, a comprehensive review examining the influence of angle and velocity on change of direction (COD) biomechanics does not exist. Findings of previous research indicate the biomechanical demands of CODs are ‘angle’ and ‘velocity’ dependent and are both critical factors that affect the technical execution of directional changes, deceleration and reacceleration requirements, knee joint loading, and lower limb muscle activity. Thus, these two factors regulate the progression and regression in COD intensity. Specifically, faster and sharper CODs elevate the relative risk of injury due to the greater associative knee joint loading; however, faster and sharper directional changes are key manoeuvres for successful performance in multidirectional sport, which subsequently creates a ‘performance-injury conflict’ for practitioners and athletes. This conflict, however, may be mediated by an athlete’s physical capacity (i.e. ability to rapidly produce force and neuromuscular control). Furthermore, an ‘angle-velocity trade-off’ exists during CODs, whereby faster approaches compromise the execution of the intended COD; this is influenced by an athlete’s physical capacity. Therefore, practitioners and researchers should acknowledge and understand the implications of angle and velocity on COD biomechanics when: (1) interpreting biomechanical research; (2) coaching COD technique; (3) designing and prescribing COD training and injury reduction programs; (4) conditioning athletes to tolerate the physical demands of directional changes; (5) screening COD technique; and (6) progressing and regressing COD intensity, specifically when working with novice or previously injured athletes rehabilitating from an injury.},

Three-dimensional motion analyses of pivoting on the preferred and non-preferred kicking limbs were performed using 10 Qualisys ‘Oqus 7ʹ infrared cameras (240 Hz). Ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected from two AMTI force platforms (1200 Hz) embedded into the running track to examine penultimate (PEN) and final (FC) contact. Both preferred and non-preferred limbs involved greater hip (ES = 2.85-3.81) and knee joint flexion angles (ES = 5.74-5.78) and peak vertical GRFs (ES = 0.87-1.61), but lower average vertical (ES = 2.55-3.01) and horizontal GRFs (ES = 3.05-3.67) during the PEN compared to the FC. Knee abduction angles were very likely greater (ES = 0.61) when turning off the non-preferred limb compared to the preferred limb. The results indicate female soccer players adopt similar braking strategy when turning off preferred and non-preferred limbs, but likely exhibit different knee joint mechanics. These findings may help us question the role of limb preference during pivoting, yet knee abduction angles and moments should be monitored with caution in female soccer players. Thus, it remains inconclusive the role limb preference plays in change of direction biomechanics for performance and risk of injury.},

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to investigate the whole-body biomechanical determinants of 180° change of direction (COD) performance. Sixty-one male athletes (age: 20.7 ± 3.8 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m, mass: 74.7 ± 10.0 kg) from multiple sports (soccer, rugby, and cricket) completed 6 trials of the modified and traditional 505 on their right leg, whereby 3D motion and ground reaction force data were collected during the COD. Pearson's and Spearman's correlations were used to explore the relationships between biomechanical variables and COD completion time. Independent t-tests and Hedges' g effect sizes were conducted between faster (top 20) and slower (bottom 20) performers to explore differences in biomechanical variables. Key kinetic and kinematic differences were demonstrated between faster and slower performers with statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) and meaningful differences (g = 0.56-2.70) observed. Faster COD performers displayed greater peak and mean horizontal propulsive forces (PF) in shorter ground contact times, more horizontally orientated peak resultant braking and PFs, greater horizontal to vertical mean and peak braking and PF ratios, greater approach velocities, and displayed greater reductions in velocity over key instances of the COD. In addition, faster performers displayed greater penultimate foot contact (PFC) hip, knee, and ankle dorsi-flexion angles, greater medial trunk lean, and greater internal pelvic and foot rotation. These aforementioned variables were also moderately to very largely (r or ρ = 0.317-0.795, p ≤ 0.013) associated with faster COD performance. Consequently, practitioners should focus not only on developing their athletes' ability to express force rapidly, but also develop their technical ability to apply force horizontally. In addition, practitioners should consider coaching a 180° turning strategy that emphasizes high PFC triple flexion for center of mass lowering while also encouraging whole-body rotation to effectively align the body toward the exit for faster performance.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have reported an association between global measures of bilateral strength and change of direction (COD) ability. Yet, little is known about the association between unilateral muscle strength qualities and COD ability. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between unilateral muscle strength qualities and COD measures (COD speed (CODS) and COD deficit) when matched limb-for-limb (i.e., right limb vs. right limb, left limb vs. left limb) in adolescent team-sport athletes. One hundred and fifteen athletes (56 males, 59 females) active in cricket, netball, and basketball participated in this investigation. Each player performed trials of countermovement jump (CMJ), single-leg hop (SLH), isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) and eccentric knee extensor torque (ECC-EXT) to assess muscle strength qualities and 505 and modified 505 (505mod) to evaluate COD ability. Moderate-to-large correlations were observed between SLH and CODS (r = −0.43 to −0.67). Another important finding was that CMJ measures demonstrated moderate-to-large correlations with CODS (r = −0.38 to −0.69) and small-to-moderate correlations with COD deficit (r = −0.24 to −0.45). COD is underpinned by distinct muscle strength qualities and each contribute to specific phases of a COD task. It is therefore likely that such connections exist between muscle strength qualities and COD, with all qualities contributing to overall COD ability.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to quantify asymmetries in change of direction (COD) performance via completion time and COD deficit, and determine its influence on asymmetry profiling of COD ability. A secondary aim was to evaluate the relationship between linear speed, 505 time and COD deficit. Forty-three youth netball athletes (age: 15.4 ± 1.1 years, height: 1.71 ± 0.06 m, mass: 63.3 ± 6.6 kg) performed the 505 for both left and right limbs and a 10 m sprint test. Asymmetries in 505 completion time and COD deficit were quantified for dominant (D) (faster) and non-dominant (ND) (slower) directions. Paired sample t-tests revealed significant differences between D and ND directions for 505 time and COD deficit (p {\textless} 0.0001, g = -0.53 to -0.60). Substantially greater asymmetries for COD deficit were observed compared to 505 time (p {\textless} 0.0001, g = 1.03). Only two subjects displayed an asymmetry ≥10\% based on 505 times. Conversely, based on COD deficit, 21 subjects demonstrated asymmetries ≥10\%. Large significant associations were observed between 505 time and COD deficit (r = 0.500-0.593, p ≤ 0.002). Large significant inverse associations were demonstrated between 10 m sprint time and COD deficit (r = -0.539 to -0.633, p ≤ 0.001) indicating faster athletes had longer COD deficits. Nine subjects were classified differently for COD ability when comparing standardized scores for 505 time versus COD deficit. Quantification of asymmetries in COD ability should be based on COD deficits; inspection of 505 times only could lead to misinterpretations of an athlete's COD symmetry and COD ability. Faster youth netball athletes demonstrate longer COD deficits, thus, researchers and practitioners are encouraged to improve their youth netball athletes' ability to rapidly decelerate, change direction and reaccelerate from 180° turns.},

A total of 115 (56 males, 59 females) athletes active in cricket, soccer, netball, and basketball performed the 505 for both left and right limbs and a 10-m sprint test. All team-sports displayed directional dominance (i.e., faster turning performance/shorter COD deficits towards a direction) (p ≤ 0.001, g = −0.62 to −0.96, −11.0\% to −28.4\%) with, male cricketers tending to demonstrate the greatest COD deficit asymmetries between directions compared to other team-sports (28.4 ± 26.5\%, g = 0.19-0.85), while female netballers displayed the lowest asymmetries (11.0 ± 10.1\%, g = 0.14-0.86). Differences in sprint and COD performance were observed between sexes and sports, with males demonstrating faster 10-m sprint times, and 505 times compared to females of the same sport. Male soccer and male cricketers displayed shorter COD deficits compared to females of the same sport; however, female court athletes demonstrated shorter COD deficits compared to male court athletes. Large significant associations (ρ = 0.631-0.643, p {\textless} 0.001) between 505 time and COD deficit were revealed, while trivial, non-significant associations (ρ ≤ −0.094, p ≥ 0.320) between COD deficit and 10-m sprint times were observed. In conclusion, male and female team-sport athletes display significant asymmetries and directional dominance during a high approach velocity 180° turning task. Coaches and practitioners are advised to apply the COD deficit for a more isolated measure of COD ability (i.e., not biased towards athletes with superior acceleration and linear speed) and perform COD speed assessments from both directions to establish directional dominance and create a COD symmetry profile.},

Only trivial-to-moderate (0.2–2.7\%, d = 0.00–0.88) and nonsignificant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) changes in early isometric force production were observed in response to the moderate-load training period, whereas very large (9.2–14.6\%, d = 2.71–4.16), significant (p ≤ 0.001) increases in early isometric force production were observed in response to high-load training. In contrast, there was a very large, significant increase in peak force (PF) across the moderate-load phase (7.7 ± 11.8\%, d = 2.02, p = 0.003), but only a moderate significant increase in PF (3.8 ± 10.6\%, d = 1.16, p = 0.001) across the high-load phase. The results of this study indicate that high-load multijoint resistance training, that follows moderate-load training, results in superior increases in early multi-joint force production, compared with the changes observed after moderate-load resistance training.},

	abstract = {Objective: To critically evaluate the effect of limb dominance on change of direction (COD) biomechanics associated with increased ACL injury-risk. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS databases. Studies that compared COD biomechanics (lower-limb/whole-body kinetics/kinematics) between limbs, contained an approach run, and included physically active participants were included. Results: Of the 456 articles identified, six were included. All studies investigated a cutting action, while the majority defined limb dominance as the preferred kicking limb, whereas one study defined limb dominance as preferred push-off cutting limb. Conflicting observations were found, with one study indicating the non-dominant and one study indicating the dominant limb displayed biomechanical deficits associated with increased non-contact ACL injury-risk during COD. Conversely, the remaining studies demonstrated no significant or substantial differences in COD biomechanics between limbs. Conclusions: Female soccer players, male rugby players, and female handball players exhibit subtle side-to-side differences when performing cutting manoeuvres. However, the limb displaying high-risk mechanics is inconsistent within and between studies and populations. Thus, it remains inconclusive for COD that limb dominance is an ACL injury-risk factor and whether a particular limb is of heightened injury-risk. Level of evidence: Level 2, Systematic review.},

Results: A very large significant relationship (ρ = 0.796, p {\textless} 0.001) between CMAS and peak KAM was observed. Subjects with higher CMASs displayed higher-risk cutting postures, including greater peak knee abduction angles, internal foot progression angles, and lateral foot plant distances (p ≤ 0.032, effect size = 0.83-1.64). Additionally, greater cutting multiplanar knee joint loads (knee flexion, internal rotation, and abduction moments) were demonstrated by subjects with higher CMASs compared to lower (p ≤ 0.047, effect size = 0.77-2.24). Conclusion: The CMAS is a valid qualitative screening tool for evaluating cutting movement quality and is therefore a potential method to identify athletes who generate high KAMs and "high-risk" side-step cutting mechanics.},

Two strength matched groups completed the twice-weekly training sessions either including the catch phase of the PC derivatives (Catch group: n = 16; age 19.3 ± 2.1 years; height 1.79 ± 0.08 m; body mass 71.14 ± 11.79 kg; PC 1 repetition maximum [1RM] 0.93 ± 0.15 kg·kg−1) or excluding the catch phase (Pull group: n = 18; age 19.8 ± 2.5 years; height 1.73 ± 0.10 m; body mass 66.43 ± 10.13 kg; PC 1RM 0.91 ± 0.18 kg·kg−1).

In contrast, RFD demonstrated lower reliability (ICC = ≤0.79; CV = ≥19\%). ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine the between-session reliability of the unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) force-time characteristics including peak force (PF), rate of force development (RFD) and impulse, in female netball athletes. Sixteen female netball athletes (19.8 ± 3.8 years; height: 180.0 ± 6.1 cm; body mass: 75.9 ± 3.4 kg) performed three unilateral stance IMTP trials per leg separated by 7 days. Between-session reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC) to determine differences between testing sessions. The results from this study suggest that absolute and relative IMTP PF should be used for assessing unilateral stance IMTP performance, due to its acceptable reliability (CV {\textless}5\%) and good sensitivity (CV{\textless}SWC). Measures of impulse also demonstrated high reliability (ICC ≥0.88; CV ≤9\%) but demonstrated poor sensitivity (CV{\textgreater}SWC). Additionally, RFD demonstrated high between-session CVs {\textgreater}19\% and poor sensitivity (CV{\textgreater}SWC). This study demonstrates that PF in the unilateral stance IMTP is most reliable. Changes in absolute IMTP PF and relative IMTP PF were {\textasciitilde}5\% and {\textasciitilde}3\%, respectively, identifying meaningful changes in response to training or competition in female netball athletes. Measures of RFD and impulse should be interpreted with caution due to their poor ability to detect the SWC.},

	abstract = {The countermovement jump (CMJ) and isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) are commonly used to compare one’s force capacity during dynamic and isometric assessments, respectively. However, little research has investigated the influence of maximum isometric strength on drop-jump (DJ) performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore differences in CMJ and DJ force-time characteristics between stronger and weaker adolescent male basketball players. Sixteen adolescent male basketball players performed the IMTP to assess measures of peak force (IMTP PF), whereas CMJ and DJ calculated a range of kinetic and kinematic variables. Peak concentric force (CMJ-PF) in the CMJ was greater for stronger players (d = 1.99). However, no differences in DJ force-time characteristics existed between stronger and weaker players. Future research should be undertaken to investigate the role of maximum strength on DJ force-time characteristics in adolescent male basketball players. Such studies may help direct the creation of athlete training and monitoring programs more effectively to represent accurate player profiling.},

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The aim of this study was to explore the effect of asymmetry on biomechanical characteristics during two 180° change of direction (CoD) tasks (505 and modified 505 [505mod]). Fifty-two male (n = 24; age = 22.1 ± 4.8 years; height = 1.78 ± 0.06 m; body mass = 76.9 ± 10.8 kg) and female (n = 28; age = 19.1 ± 1.7 years; height = 1.67 ± 0.06 m; body mass = 60.4 ± 7.4 kg) team-sport players were recruited for this investigation. Three-dimensional motion data using 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force (GRF) data from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze penultimate contacts (PEN) and final foot contacts. A series of repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to examine for differences in each dependent variable. Significant differences existed between dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) limbs for knee abduction angle (KAA) during 505mod (p = 0.048), while significant differences existed for peak horizontal and vertical GRF (vGRF) (p {\textless} 0.001) during 505. For both tasks, the PEN involved significantly greater peak vGRF, hip flexion angles, hip extensor moments, knee flexion angles, and knee extensor moments, but lower average vGRF, horizontal GRF, and peak ankle extensor moments. For 505, the ND limb involved significantly greater peak vGRF, but the opposite was revealed for peak horizontal GRF. For 505mod, the D limb involved significantly greater KAAs. Finally, there was a significant interaction (group × limb) for peak horizontal GRF ratio during 505. For both tasks, there was no interaction or main effects for time to completion. Therefore, it appears asymmetry influences GRFs and KAAs, but not completion time during 180° CoD in team-sport players.},

Twenty university male soccer players performed three COD trials, whereby GRFs were collected over the aforementioned foot contacts. Greater peak braking forces in shorter ground contact times were demonstrated over the APFC compared to the PFC and FFC (p ≤ 0.011, d = 0.96–7.82), while APFC mean GRFs were greater than the PFC (p ≤ 0.001, d = 1.86–7.57). Faster 505 performance was associated with greater APFC peak and mean vertical, horizontal, and resultant braking GRFs (r² = 21.6–54.5\%), greater FFC mean HGRFs (r² = 38.8\%), more horizontally orientated peak resultant APFC and PFC GRFs (r² = 22.8–55.4\%), and greater APFC, PFC, and FFC mean horizontal to vertical GRF ratios (r² = 32.0–61.9\%). Overall, the APFC plays a more pivotal role in facilitating deceleration compared to the PFC for effective 505 performance. Practitioners should develop their athletes’ technical ability to express force horizontally across all foot contacts and coach braking strategies that emphasise greater magnitudes of posteriorly directed APFC GRFs to facilitate faster 505 performance.},

Twenty-eight soccer players (14 males and 14 females) performed 180° turns with ground reaction forces collected over penultimate and final contacts. A two-way (contact × limb) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were run to examine differences between contact (penultimate and final) or limb (dominant and non-dominant) for sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle peak angles and moments, and frontal plane knee abduction moments and angles between sexes. Average horizontal GRF was increased on the dominant limb, compared to non-dominant and for the final contact compared to the penultimate contact. Knee abduction angles were increased in females compared to males, while the opposite was true for knee abduction moments. Statistically significant differences were evident, with increases in peak vertical GRF, peak hip flexion angle, peak knee flexion angle, peak knee extensor moment, and peak ankle dorsiflexion angle observed in the penultimate contact compared to final contact. The results indicate the penultimate contact during turns helps reduce loading on the final contact, yet male and female soccer players exhibit different knee joint mechanics during pre-planned change of direction},

Forty-three athletes from different sports (rowing, soccer, bicycle motocross, and hockey) performed three trials of the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and IMTP, and performed a one repetition maximum power clean (PC). Reactive strength index modified (RSImod) was also calculated from the CMJ. Statistically significant large correlations between IMTP force-time characteristics and PC (ρ = 0.569–0.674, p {\textless} 0.001), and moderate correlations between IMTP force-time characteristics (excluding force at 100 ms) and RSImod (ρ = 0.389–0.449, p = 0.013–0.050) were observed. Only force at 250 ms demonstrated a statistically significant moderate correlation with CMJ height (ρ = 0.346, p = 0.016) and no statistically significant associations were observed between IMTP force-time characteristics and SJ height. Stronger athletes (top 10) demonstrated statistically significantly greater CMJ heights, RSImods, and PCs (p ≤ 0.004, g = 1.32–1.89) compared to weaker (bottom 10) athletes, but no differences in SJ height were observed (p = 0.871, g = 0.06). These findings highlight that the ability to apply rapidly high levels of force in short time intervals is integral for PC, CMJ height, and reactive strength.},

Fifty-two female netball players (age 23.9 ± 5.4 yrs, height 169.9 ± 3.3 cm, body mass 65.2 ± 4.6 kg) performed 6 trials of the 505 COD test, three with a flying start and three with a stationary start, once per week over a four week period, to determine within- and between-session reliability. Testing revealed high within-session reliability for the stationary start (ICC = 0.96-0.97) and for the flying start (ICC = 0.90-0.97). Similarly, both the stationary start (ICC = 0.965) and the flying start demonstrated high reliability (ICC = 0.951) between-sessions, although repeated measures analysis of variance (p{\textless}0.001) revealed learning effects were found to be present between-sessions for both tests. Performances stabilized on the second day for the static start and on the third day of testing for the flying start. Results suggest that the 505 COD test is a reliable test in female netball players, with either a stationary or flying start. Smallest detectable differences of 3.91\% and 3.97\% for the stationary start and the flying start, respectively, allow practitioners to interpret whether changes in time taken to complete the 505 COD test reflect genuine improvements in performance or are measurement errors. It is suggested that one day of familiarization testing is performed for the stationary start and two days of familiarization for the flying start, to minimize learning effects.},

Thirty-six male collegiate team-sport (23 Rugby/13 Soccer) athletes (age: 20 ± 1.4 years; height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m; mass: 83 ± 13.2 kg) participated in the study. Each athlete performed 3 trials of a 20-m sprint (with 5 and 10 m splits) and 2 change of direction (COD) tests (90° cut and 505 tests) cutting/turning from both legs. Completion times for all sprint and COD tests were measured using timing cells. For both COD tests, CODD was determined (COD completion time-10 m sprint time). Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationships between sprint times and CODD and completion times. Significant (p {\textless} 0.001) moderate-to-large (r ≥ 0.467) correlations between sprint times and 90° cut completion times for left and right cuts were observed. Nonsignificant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) trivial-to-small correlations (r ≤ 0.199) were found between sprint variables and 90° cut CODD. Significant (p {\textless} 0.001) large to very large correlations (r ≥ 0.531) were revealed between the left and right 90° cut and 90° cut CODD. The results suggest that the CODD could be applied to isolate and assess the cutting ability in COD speed tests that involve a single cutting maneuver. Failure to inspect CODD could lead to incorrect evaluation of an athletes cutting or COD ability.},

	abstract = {Change of direction (COD) manoeuvres are associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk due to the propensity to generate large multiplanar knee joint loads. Given the short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury, practitioners are interested in methods that reduce knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading. An effective strategy to reduce ACL loading is modifying an athlete’s movement mechanics to reduce knee joint loading. The purpose of this scoping review was to critically appraise and comprehensively synthesise the existing literature related to the effects of training interventions on COD biomechanics associated with increased knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading, and identify gaps and recommend areas for future research. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of pre-post analysis of a COD task, a minimum 4-week training intervention, and assessments of biomechanical characteristics associated with increased ACL loading. Of the 1,027 articles identified, 22 were included in the scoping review. Based on current literature, balance training and COD technique modification are the most effective training modalities for reducing knee joint loading (small to moderate effect sizes). One study reported dynamic core stability training was effective in reducing knee joint loads, but further research is needed to definitively confirm the efficacy of this method. Perturbation-enhanced plyometric training, the F-MARC 11 + soccer specific warm-up, Oslo Neuromuscular warm-up, and resistance training are ineffective training modalities to reduce COD knee joint loads. Conflicting findings have been observed for the Core-Pac and mixed training programme. Consequently, practitioners should consider incorporating balance and COD technique modification drills into their athletes’ training programmes to reduce potentially hazardous knee joint loads when changing direction. However, training intervention studies can be improved by investigating larger sample sizes ({\textgreater} 20), including a control group, acknowledging measurement error when interpreting their findings, and considering performance implications, to confirm the effectiveness of training interventions and improve adherence.},

The aim of this study was to examine the role of ECC-STR during a 180° COD task in 18 female soccer players. Each player performed six trials of a 180° COD task whereby three-dimensional motion data from 10 Qualisys Pro-Reflex infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction forces (GRFs) from two AMTI force platforms (1200 Hz) were collected. Relative eccentric knee extensor (ECC-EXT) and flexor (ECC-FLEX) peak torque was collected from both limbs at 60°·s−1 using a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer. Large correlations were revealed between COD performance (time to complete 5 m approach, 180° turn, 5 m return) and ECC-EXT (R = −0.674) and ECC-FLEX (R = −0.603). Moderate to large correlations were observed between approach velocity (AV) and COD performance (R = −0.484) and ECC-EXT (R = 0.724). Stronger participants (n = 9) recorded significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) faster AV (4.01 ± 0.18 vs. 3.74 ± 0.24 m·s−1, d = 1.27) and a greater reduction in velocity (−1.55 ± 0.17 vs. −1.37 ± 0.21 m·s−1, d = −0.94) during penultimate contact than weaker (n = 9) subjects. Greater ECC-STR is associated with faster COD performance in female soccer players, as stronger players are better able to decelerate during penultimate contact from faster approach velocities.},
