abstract: "Cuthbert, M, Thomas, C, Dos'Santos, T, and Jones, PA. Application of change\
  \ of direction deficit to evaluate cutting ability. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2138-2144,\
  \ 2019-The purpose of this study was to examine the application of the change of\
  \ direction deficit (CODD) to a 90° cut test to examine whether CODD provides a\
  \ unique evaluation of an individual's cutting ability. Thirty-six male collegiate\
  \ team-sport (23 Rugby/13 Soccer) athletes (age: 20 ± 1.4 years; height: 1.80 ±\
  \ 0.08 m; mass: 83 ± 13.2 kg) participated in the study. Each athlete performed\
  \ 3 trials of a 20-m sprint (with 5 and 10 m splits) and 2 change of direction (COD)\
  \ tests (90° cut and 505 tests) cutting/turning from both legs. Completion times\
  \ for all sprint and COD tests were measured using timing cells. For both COD tests,\
  \ CODD was determined (COD completion time-10 m sprint time). Pearson correlation\
  \ was used to explore the relationships between sprint times and CODD and completion\
  \ times. Significant (p textless 0.001) moderate-to-large (r ≥ 0.467) correlations\
  \ between sprint times and 90° cut completion times for left and right cuts were\
  \ observed. Nonsignificant (p textgreater 0.05) trivial-to-small correlations (r\
  \ ≤ 0.199) were found between sprint variables and 90° cut CODD. Significant (p\
  \ textless 0.001) large to very large correlations (r ≥ 0.531) were revealed between\
  \ the left and right 90° cut and 90° cut CODD. The results suggest that the CODD\
  \ could be applied to isolate and assess the cutting ability in COD speed tests\
  \ that involve a single cutting maneuver. Failure to inspect CODD could lead to\
  \ incorrect evaluation of an athletes cutting or COD ability."
