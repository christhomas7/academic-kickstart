abstract: THERE IS A LACK OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH INTO THE DEMANDS AND
  THE SPECIFIC AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED TO OPTIMIZE PERFOR- MANCE AND REDUCE
  THE RISK OF COMMON INJURIES IN FEMALE NETBALL ATHLETES. NETBALL IS PREDOMINANTLY
  ANAEROBIC, CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT HIGH-INTENSITY MOVEMENTS THAT REQUIRE HIGH
  LEVELS OF STRENGTH, POWER, AND LOWER LIMB CONTROL. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH
  IN THE PREPARATION OF FEMALE NETBALL PLAYERS FOR TRAINING AND COMPETITION. IN THIS
  REVIEW, WE PRESENT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DEMANDS OF TRAINING AND COMPETITION, COMMON
  CAUSES OF INJURY, AND STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING TRAINING RECOM- MENDATIONS TO ENHANCE
  PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INJURY IN FEMALE NETBALL PLAYERS.
