abstract: 'Purpose: To determine the reliability and variability of the Dynamic Strength
  Index (DSI) calculated from squat-jump (SJ) vs countermovement-jump (CMJ) peak force
  (PF) and to compare DSI values between methods. Methods: Male youth soccer and rugby
  league players (N = 27; age 17.2 ± 0.7 y, height 173.9 ± 5.7 cm, body mass 71.1 ± 7.2
  kg) performed 3 trials of the SJ, CMJ, and isometric midthigh pull (IMTP) on 2 separate
  days. DSI was calculated by dividing the PF during each jump by the IMTP PF. Results:
  DSI-SJ exhibited moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .419) within-session
  reliability and high variability (percentage coefficient of variation [%CV] = 15.91)
  during session 1; however, this improved noticeably during session 2 (ICC = .948,
  %CV = 4.03). In contrast, DSI-CMJ showed nearly perfect within-session reliability
  (ICC = .920–.952) and low variability (%CV = 3.80–4.57) for both sessions. Moreover,
  DSI-SJ values demonstrated a small yet significant increase between sessions (P = .01,
  d = 0.37), whereas only a trivial and nonsignificant increase was observed for DSI-CMJ
  between sessions (P = .796, d = 0.07). Between-sessions reliability was very high
  for the DSI-SJ (ICC = .741) and nearly perfect for the DSI-CMJ (ICC = .924). There
  was no significant or meaningful difference (P = .261, d = 0.12) between DSI-SJ
  (0.82 ± 0.18) and DSI-CMJ (0.84 ± 0.15). Conclusions: Practitioners should use DSI-CMJ,
  as it is a more reliable measure than DSI-SJ, although it produces similar ratios.'
