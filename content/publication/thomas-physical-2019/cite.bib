 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the height, body mass and physical characteristics of female academy netball players by position (centers, defenders and shooters). Data were collected on 43 regional academy players during the preseason period and comprised of height and body mass, and physical characteristics (single-leg hop [SLH], squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ], 5- and 10-m sprint, 505 and cardiorespiratory fitness). Defenders and shooters demonstrated significantly (p = \textless 0.05; d ≥ 1.1) greater body mass compared to centers. Defenders demonstrated significantly (p = \textless 0.05; d = 1.6) greater height compared to centers, however no significant differences were noted between centers and shooters (p = 0.19; d = 0.7) and defenders and shooters (p = 0.70; d = 0.5). Centers performed better during the SLH left leg (p = 0.01; d = 1.0), SJ (p = 0.03; d = 1.1), CMJ (p = 0.01; d = 1.4), 5 m (p = 0.04; d ≥ -0.9) and 10 m sprint (p = 0.01; d = -1.2), 505 left (p ≤ 0.03; d ≥ 1.0), 505 right (p ≤ 0.03; d = 1.3), and cardiorespiratory fitness (p = 0.01; d ≥ 1.2), compared to other positions. No other significant differences were observed. These findings demonstrate that height, body mass and physical characteristics differ between positions in female netball players, and provide normative data for English academy netball players. Strength and conditioning coaches should consider the specific demands on individual positions when training female netball players.},
