abstract: 'The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine differences in change
  of direction (COD) performance and asymmetries between team-sports while considering
  the effects of sex and sport; (2) to evaluate the relationship between linear speed,
  COD completion time, and COD deficit. A total of 115 (56 males, 59 females) athletes
  active in cricket, soccer, netball, and basketball performed the 505 for both left
  and right limbs and a 10-m sprint test. All team-sports displayed directional dominance
  (i.e., faster turning performance/shorter COD deficits towards a direction) (p ≤
  0.001, g = −0.62 to −0.96, −11.0% to −28.4%) with, male cricketers tending to demonstrate
  the greatest COD deficit asymmetries between directions compared to other team-sports
  (28.4 ± 26.5%, g = 0.19-0.85), while female netballers displayed the lowest asymmetries
  (11.0 ± 10.1%, g = 0.14-0.86). Differences in sprint and COD performance were observed
  between sexes and sports, with males demonstrating faster 10-m sprint times, and
  505 times compared to females of the same sport. Male soccer and male cricketers
  displayed shorter COD deficits compared to females of the same sport; however, female
  court athletes demonstrated shorter COD deficits compared to male court athletes.
  Large significant associations (ρ = 0.631-0.643, p textless 0.001) between 505 time
  and COD deficit were revealed, while trivial, non-significant associations (ρ ≤
  −0.094, p ≥ 0.320) between COD deficit and 10-m sprint times were observed. In conclusion,
  male and female team-sport athletes display significant asymmetries and directional
  dominance during a high approach velocity 180° turning task. Coaches and practitioners
  are advised to apply the COD deficit for a more isolated measure of COD ability
  (i.e., not biased towards athletes with superior acceleration and linear speed)
  and perform COD speed assessments from both directions to establish directional
  dominance and create a COD symmetry profile.'
