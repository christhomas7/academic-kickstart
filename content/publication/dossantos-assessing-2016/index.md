abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the within-session\
  \ reliability of bilateral and unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP)\
  \ force-time characteristics including peak force (PF), relative PF and impulse\
  \ at time bands (0-100, 0-200, 0-250 and 0-300 ms); and to compare isometric force-time\
  \ characteristics between right and left and dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND)\
  \ limbs. Methods: Professional male Rugby league and multi-sport collegiate male\
  \ athletes (n=54, age 23.4 ± 4.2 years, height 1.80 ± 0.05 m, mass: 88.9 ± 12.9\
  \ kg) performed 3 bilateral IMTP trials, and 3 unilateral stance IMTP trials per\
  \ leg on a force plate sampling at 600 Hz. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients\
  \ (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV) demonstrated high-within session reliability\
  \ for bilateral and unilateral IMTP PF (ICC =.94, CV = 4.7-5.5%). Lower reliability\
  \ measures and greater variability were observed for bilateral and unilateral IMTP\
  \ impulse at time bands (ICC =.81-.88, CV =7.7-11.8%). Paired sample t-tests and\
  \ Cohen's d effect sizes revealed no significant differences for all isometric force-time\
  \ characteristics between right and left limbs in collegiate male athletes (p textgreater.05,\
  \ d ≤0.32) and professional rugby league players (p textgreater.05, d ≤0.11), however\
  \ significant differences were found between D and ND limbs in male collegiate athletes\
  \ (p textless.001, d = 0.43-0.91) and professional rugby league players (p textless\
  \ .001, d = 0.27-0.46). Conclusion: This study demonstrated high within-session\
  \ reliability for unilateral stance IMTP PF; revealing significant differences in\
  \ isometric force-time characteristics between D and ND limbs in male athletes."
