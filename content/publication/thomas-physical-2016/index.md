abstract: 'Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the height, body
  mass and physical characteristics of English regional academy netball players by
  age category (under 15s, under 17s and under 19s). Design and Methods: Data were
  collected on 50 regional academy players during the preseason period and comprised
  of height, body mass, and physical (single and triple hop, 5-and 10-m sprint, 505
  change of direction speed, vertical jump, and cardiore-spiratory fitness) characteristics.
  Results: One-way analysis of variance revealed the under 19s group demonstrated
  superior (p textless 0.05) performances compared to the under 15s group in single
  hop left (U15: 1.61 ± 0.18 m; U19: 1.88 ± 0.09 m; p = 0.001), single hop right (U15:
  1.66 ± 0.17 m; U19: 1.87 ± 0.13 m; p = 0.001), triple hop left (U15: 5.10 ± 0.58
  m; U19: 5.90 ± 0.39 m; p = 0.001), triple hop right (U15: 5.10 ± 0.50 m; U19: 5.86
  ± 0.41 m; p = 0.001), 5-m sprint (U15: 1.15 ± 0.05 seconds; U19: 1.10 ± 0.07 seconds;
  p = 0.032), 505 left (U15: 2.59 ± 0.08 seconds; U19: 2.45 ± 0.08 seconds; p = 0.001),
  505 right (U15: 2.54 ± 0.13 seconds; U19: 2.43 ± 0.06 seconds ; p = 0.007), squat
  jump (U15: 0.34 ± 0.04 m; U19: 0.41 ± 0.05 m; p = 0.001), countermovement jump (U15:
  0.35 ± 0.04 m; U19: 0.42 ± 0.05 m; p = 0.001), and cardiorespiratory fitness (U15:
  16.40 ± 0.83 km • hˉ ¹ ; U19: 18.14 ± 1.10 km • hˉ ¹ ; p = 0.001). Moreover, the
  under 17s group reported significantly better (p textless 0.05) performances in
  single leg hop left (U15: 1.61 ± 0.18 m; U17: 1.74 ± 0.12 m; p = 0.033), single
  hop right, triple hop left (U15: 5.10 ± 0.58 m; U17: 5.59 ± 0.35 m; p = 0.008),
  triple hop right (U15: 5.10 ± 0.50 m; U17: 5.50 ± 0.36 m; p = 0.031), countermovement
  jump (U15: 0.35 ± 0.04 m; U17: 0.39 ± 0.03 m; p = 0.018), and cardiorespiratory
  fitness (U15: 16.40 ± 0.83 km • hˉ ¹ ; U17: 17.56 ± 1.30 km • hˉ ¹ ; p = 0.014)
  than the under 15s group. Conclusions: These findings highlight that height, body
  mass, and physical characteristics develop across age categories and provide normative
  data for English regional academy netball players. (Journal of Trainology 2016;5:30-37)'
