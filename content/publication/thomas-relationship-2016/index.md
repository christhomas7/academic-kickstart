abstract: "Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to determine the relationships\
  \ between isometric strength, sprint, and change of direction speed (CODS) performance\
  \ in academy cricketers. Design and Methods: Eighteen male academy cricketers (mean\
  \ ± SD; age = 17.1 ± 0.7 years; height = 175.8 ± 6.1 cm; mass = 71.7 ± 11.3 kg)\
  \ performed tests of bilateral and unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP),\
  \ sprint, and change of direction speed (CODS) across two separate testing sessions.\
  \ Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with relative peak force (PF\
  \ [N • kgˉ¹]) determined for bilateral stance (IMTP PF), left leg (IMTP L PF), and\
  \ right leg (IMTP R PF). Sprint and CODS performances was measured using 5-, 10-,\
  \ and 20-m sprint performance, and traditional 505 (505) and modified 505 (505mod)\
  \ tests. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and CODS performances) were\
  \ analysed using Pearson's product – moment correlation. Results: Results suggest\
  \ that IMTP R PF displayed the strongest relationships with sprint performance (r\
  \ = − 0.49 to − 0.52). Times to complete 505 CODS were significantly correlated\
  \ with bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.47 to − 0.65), whereas modified\
  \ 505mod CODS performance demonstrated no correlation to either bilateral or unilateral\
  \ stance IMTP PF (r = − 0.31 to − 0.44). Conclusions: There are no significant relationships\
  \ between bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP PF and 505mod CODS. Furthermore,\
  \ there are no significant relationships between bilateral stance IMTP PF and sprint\
  \ performance. However, this study identified bilateral and unilateral stance IMTP\
  \ PF to relate to 505 CODS."
