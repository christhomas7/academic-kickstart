 abstract = {The investigation of inter-limb asymmetries has increased in recent years, with practitioners and researchers typically exploring the impact of inter-limb asymmetry on athletic performance, screening inter-limb asymmetry in relation to injury risk, and monitoring of inter-limb asymmetry during injury rehabilitation. A contentious issue regarding the profiling of inter-limb asymmetry is the use of thresholds to determine whether an athlete displays a 'meaningful' or potentially 'problematic' asymmetry and how to interpret such data. This article aims to outline the potential options available for practitioners and researchers regarding the quantification, monitoring, and interpretation of inter-limb asymmetries.},
