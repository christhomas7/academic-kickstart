abstract: "Dos'Santos, T, Jones, PA, Comfort, P, and Thomas, C. Effect of different\
  \ onset thresholds on isometric midthigh pull force-time variables. J Strength Cond\
  \ Res 31(12): 3463–3473, 2017—Various thresholds have been used to identify the\
  \ onset of contraction during isometric midthigh pull (IMTP); however, no agreed\
  \ onset threshold exists for this assessment. The purpose of this study was to compare\
  \ relative body weight (BW) and arbitrary onset thresholds to a criterion onset\
  \ threshold 5 SDs of BW for IMTP force-time variables; force at each threshold,\
  \ peak force, time-specific force values (100, 150, and 200 ms), and rate of force\
  \ development (RFD) during 0–100, 0–150, 0–200 ms. Academy rugby league players\
  \ (n = 9, age: 18.5 ± 0.4 years; height: 1.82 ± 0.09 m; mass: 91.2 ± 13.1 kg) performed\
  \ 2 IMTP trials on a force platform sampling at 1,000 Hz. The neutral force-time\
  \ data pool (18 trials) was analyzed with five different thresholds and compared\
  \ with criterion threshold to determine any variance in force-time variables. Five\
  \ SDs of BW were significantly lower than 10% BW and 75 N for threshold force which\
  \ led to significantly greater time-specific force values at 100 and 150 ms and\
  \ unacceptable limits of agreements (LOA) for all force-time variables. No significant\
  \ differences (p textgreater 0.05) were observed between 2.5% and 5 SDs of BW; and\
  \ between 5% and 5 SDs of BW for threshold force and all force-time variables with\
  \ acceptable LOA. The 5 SDs of BW and 2.5% BW onset thresholds consistently resulted\
  \ in the lowest values for threshold force, time-specific force values, and RFD,\
  \ attributed to a lower onset bias. Therefore, scientists and practitioners are\
  \ recommended to use a 5 SD of BW onset threshold for time-specific force values\
  \ and RFD for accurate data because it accounts for signal noise during the weighing\
  \ period. Subsequently, there is greater certainty that the onset of contraction\
  \ identifies a true meaningful change in force, in contrast to relative BW thresholds."
