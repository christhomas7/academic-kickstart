abstract: 'Peak force and impulse recorded from a unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh
  pull are reliable methods of assessing unilateral isometric force production capabilities
  (ICC ≥0.85; CV ≤9%). In contrast, RFD demonstrated lower reliability (ICC = ≤0.79;
  CV = ≥19%). ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine the between-session
  reliability of the unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) force-time
  characteristics including peak force (PF), rate of force development (RFD) and impulse,
  in female netball athletes. Sixteen female netball athletes (19.8 ± 3.8 years; height:
  180.0 ± 6.1 cm; body mass: 75.9 ± 3.4 kg) performed three unilateral stance IMTP
  trials per leg separated by 7 days. Between-session reliability was assessed by
  intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed
  as a coefficient of variation (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC) to determine
  differences between testing sessions. The results from this study suggest that absolute
  and relative IMTP PF should be used for assessing unilateral stance IMTP performance,
  due to its acceptable reliability (CV textless5%) and good sensitivity (CVtextlessSWC).
  Measures of impulse also demonstrated high reliability (ICC ≥0.88; CV ≤9%) but demonstrated
  poor sensitivity (CVtextgreaterSWC). Additionally, RFD demonstrated high between-session
  CVs textgreater19% and poor sensitivity (CVtextgreaterSWC). This study demonstrates
  that PF in the unilateral stance IMTP is most reliable. Changes in absolute IMTP
  PF and relative IMTP PF were ~5% and ~3%, respectively, identifying meaningful changes
  in response to training or competition in female netball athletes. Measures of RFD
  and impulse should be interpreted with caution due to their poor ability to detect
  the SWC.'
