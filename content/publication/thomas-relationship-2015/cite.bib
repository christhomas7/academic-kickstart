 abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to assess the use of isometric strength testing as a determinant of sprint and change of direction performance in collegiate athletes. Design and Methods: Fourteen male collegiate athletes (mean ± SD; age = 21 ± 2.4 years; height =176 ± 9.0 cm; body mass = 72.8 ± 9.4 kg) participated in the study. Maximal strength was assessed via an isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with peak force (IPF), maximum rate of force development (mRFD), impulse at 100 ms (IP 100) and 300 ms (IP 300) determined. Sprint and COD performance was measured using 5-and 20-m sprint performance, and a modified 505 test. Relationships between variables (IMTP, sprint and COD) were analysed using Pearson's product – moment correlation. Results: Results suggest that IP 300 displayed the strongest relationships with 5-and 20-m sprint performance (r = −0.51 and −0.54, respectively). The results demonstrate maximum force production measures during IMTP correlate to sprint and COD ability in collegiate athletes. Conclusion: Isometric mid-thigh pull force-time measures are related to athletic performance (acceleration and sprinting), and thus are recommended for use in athlete monitoring and assessment.},
