abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the height, body mass and physical
  characteristics of female academy netball players by position (centers, defenders
  and shooters). Data were collected on 43 regional academy players during the preseason
  period and comprised of height and body mass, and physical characteristics (single-leg
  hop [SLH], squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ], 5- and 10-m sprint, 505
  and cardiorespiratory fitness). Defenders and shooters demonstrated significantly
  (p = textless 0.05; d ≥ 1.1) greater body mass compared to centers. Defenders demonstrated
  significantly (p = textless 0.05; d = 1.6) greater height compared to centers, however
  no significant differences were noted between centers and shooters (p = 0.19; d
  = 0.7) and defenders and shooters (p = 0.70; d = 0.5). Centers performed better
  during the SLH left leg (p = 0.01; d = 1.0), SJ (p = 0.03; d = 1.1), CMJ (p = 0.01;
  d = 1.4), 5 m (p = 0.04; d ≥ -0.9) and 10 m sprint (p = 0.01; d = -1.2), 505 left
  (p ≤ 0.03; d ≥ 1.0), 505 right (p ≤ 0.03; d = 1.3), and cardiorespiratory fitness
  (p = 0.01; d ≥ 1.2), compared to other positions. No other significant differences
  were observed. These findings demonstrate that height, body mass and physical characteristics
  differ between positions in female netball players, and provide normative data for
  English academy netball players. Strength and conditioning coaches should consider
  the specific demands on individual positions when training female netball players.
