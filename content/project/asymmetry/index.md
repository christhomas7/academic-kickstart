This research theme covers multiple projects including methods of assessing and monitoring interlimb asymmetry. Specificlly, determining whether an athlete displays a “meaningful” or potentially “problematic” asymmetry and how to interpret such data. The potential considerations for practitioners and researchers regarding the quantification, monitoring, and interpretation of interlimb asymmetries are explored herewithin. Industry collaborations are welcome - please get in contact with ideas for potential projects.
