abstract: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the reliability of the
  30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (30-15IFT) in semi-professional soccer players.
  Fourteen male semi-professional soccer players performed the 30-15IFT on two occasions,
  separated by 7 days. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient
  (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed as a coefficient of variation
  (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC), to determine any significant difference
  between testing sessions. Maximal intermittent running velocity (VIFT) demonstrated
  good reliability (ICC = .80) for between session reliability. The CV was 2.5% for
  between session reliability of the 30-15IFT. As the SWC (0.70 km/h) falls within
  the range in which the individual's true score is likely to lie (1.0 km/h), the
  usefulness of the VIFT was rated as 'Marginal'. Despite the usefulness of the 30-15IFT
  being deemed 'Marginal', a change in performance as small as 1.0 km/h (2 stages)
  in VIFT could be considered substantial or 'real'. This study demonstrates that
  VIFT in the 30-15IFT is reliable, resulting in a reliable assessment of team-sport
  specific cardiorespiratory fitness, with changes as small as 1.0 km/h (2 stages)
  in VIFT considered meaningful.
