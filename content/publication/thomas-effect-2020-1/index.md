abstract: "Thomas, C, Dos'Santos, T, Comfort, P, and Jones, PA. Effect of asymmetry\
  \ on biomechanical characteristics during 180° change of direction. J Strength Cond\
  \ Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The aim of this study was to explore the effect of asymmetry\
  \ on biomechanical characteristics during two 180° change of direction (CoD) tasks\
  \ (505 and modified 505 [505mod]). Fifty-two male (n = 24; age = 22.1 ± 4.8 years;\
  \ height = 1.78 ± 0.06 m; body mass = 76.9 ± 10.8 kg) and female (n = 28; age =\
  \ 19.1 ± 1.7 years; height = 1.67 ± 0.06 m; body mass = 60.4 ± 7.4 kg) team-sport\
  \ players were recruited for this investigation. Three-dimensional motion data using\
  \ 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force (GRF) data\
  \ from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze penultimate contacts\
  \ (PEN) and final foot contacts. A series of repeated-measures analysis of variance\
  \ were used to examine for differences in each dependent variable. Significant differences\
  \ existed between dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) limbs for knee abduction angle\
  \ (KAA) during 505mod (p = 0.048), while significant differences existed for peak\
  \ horizontal and vertical GRF (vGRF) (p textless 0.001) during 505. For both tasks,\
  \ the PEN involved significantly greater peak vGRF, hip flexion angles, hip extensor\
  \ moments, knee flexion angles, and knee extensor moments, but lower average vGRF,\
  \ horizontal GRF, and peak ankle extensor moments. For 505, the ND limb involved\
  \ significantly greater peak vGRF, but the opposite was revealed for peak horizontal\
  \ GRF. For 505mod, the D limb involved significantly greater KAAs. Finally, there\
  \ was a significant interaction (group × limb) for peak horizontal GRF ratio during\
  \ 505. For both tasks, there was no interaction or main effects for time to completion.\
  \ Therefore, it appears asymmetry influences GRFs and KAAs, but not completion time\
  \ during 180° CoD in team-sport players."
