Understanding the dose-response relationship is fundamental to athletic monitoring and sports science. Monitoring of individual players "dose" of exercise is now possible through wearable multi-sensor technology fusing GPS, accelerometry and gyroscopic data. Research in this theme has redressed the balance between metabolic and mechanical dose and response (see Vanrenterghem et al. 2017) whilst exploring if relevant field based measures are possible.

Award winning PhD students Niels Nedergaard (Young Investigator Award - Aspire Monitoring Athlete Training Loads Conference, Doha, Qatar) and Jasper Verheul (BJSM -  PhD Academy Award) have fully evaluated the challenge of predicting ground reaction forces from acceleration signals (see Nedergaard et al. 2018) and summarising the challenge of making field-based biomechanical measurements for practioners (see Verheul et al. 2020)
