abstract: "Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to assess the use of isometric\
  \ strength testing as a determinant of sprint and change of direction performance\
  \ in collegiate athletes. Design and Methods: Fourteen male collegiate athletes\
  \ (mean ± SD; age = 21 ± 2.4 years; height =176 ± 9.0 cm; body mass = 72.8 ± 9.4\
  \ kg) participated in the study. Maximal strength was assessed via an isometric\
  \ mid-thigh pull (IMTP). Isometric mid-thigh pull testing involved trials with peak\
  \ force (IPF), maximum rate of force development (mRFD), impulse at 100 ms (IP 100)\
  \ and 300 ms (IP 300) determined. Sprint and COD performance was measured using\
  \ 5-and 20-m sprint performance, and a modified 505 test. Relationships between\
  \ variables (IMTP, sprint and COD) were analysed using Pearson's product – moment\
  \ correlation. Results: Results suggest that IP 300 displayed the strongest relationships\
  \ with 5-and 20-m sprint performance (r = −0.51 and −0.54, respectively). The results\
  \ demonstrate maximum force production measures during IMTP correlate to sprint\
  \ and COD ability in collegiate athletes. Conclusion: Isometric mid-thigh pull force-time\
  \ measures are related to athletic performance (acceleration and sprinting), and\
  \ thus are recommended for use in athlete monitoring and assessment."
