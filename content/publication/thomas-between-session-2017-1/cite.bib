 abstract = {Peak force and impulse recorded from a unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull are reliable methods of assessing unilateral isometric force production capabilities (ICC ≥0.85; CV ≤9%). In contrast, RFD demonstrated lower reliability (ICC = ≤0.79; CV = ≥19%). ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine the between-session reliability of the unilateral stance isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) force-time characteristics including peak force (PF), rate of force development (RFD) and impulse, in female netball athletes. Sixteen female netball athletes (19.8 ± 3.8 years; height: 180.0 ± 6.1 cm; body mass: 75.9 ± 3.4 kg) performed three unilateral stance IMTP trials per leg separated by 7 days. Between-session reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TE) expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV), and smallest worthwhile change (SWC) to determine differences between testing sessions. The results from this study suggest that absolute and relative IMTP PF should be used for assessing unilateral stance IMTP performance, due to its acceptable reliability (CV \textless5%) and good sensitivity (CV\textlessSWC). Measures of impulse also demonstrated high reliability (ICC ≥0.88; CV ≤9%) but demonstrated poor sensitivity (CV\textgreaterSWC). Additionally, RFD demonstrated high between-session CVs \textgreater19% and poor sensitivity (CV\textgreaterSWC). This study demonstrates that PF in the unilateral stance IMTP is most reliable. Changes in absolute IMTP PF and relative IMTP PF were ~5% and ~3%, respectively, identifying meaningful changes in response to training or competition in female netball athletes. Measures of RFD and impulse should be interpreted with caution due to their poor ability to detect the SWC.},
