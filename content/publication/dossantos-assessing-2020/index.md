abstract: The investigation of inter-limb asymmetries has increased in recent years,
  with practitioners and researchers typically exploring the impact of inter-limb
  asymmetry on athletic performance, screening inter-limb asymmetry in relation to
  injury risk, and monitoring of inter-limb asymmetry during injury rehabilitation.
  A contentious issue regarding the profiling of inter-limb asymmetry is the use of
  thresholds to determine whether an athlete displays a 'meaningful' or potentially
  'problematic' asymmetry and how to interpret such data. This article aims to outline
  the potential options available for practitioners and researchers regarding the
  quantification, monitoring, and interpretation of inter-limb asymmetries.
