abstract: Previous studies have reported an association between eccentric strength
  (ECC-STR) and change of direction (COD) ability. Little is known about how ECC-STR
  facilitates COD maneuvers. The aim of this study was to examine the role of ECC-STR
  during a 180° COD task in 18 female soccer players. Each player performed six trials
  of a 180° COD task whereby three-dimensional motion data from 10 Qualisys Pro-Reflex
  infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction forces (GRFs) from two AMTI force
  platforms (1200 Hz) were collected. Relative eccentric knee extensor (ECC-EXT) and
  flexor (ECC-FLEX) peak torque was collected from both limbs at 60°·s−1 using a Kin
  Com isokinetic dynamometer. Large correlations were revealed between COD performance
  (time to complete 5 m approach, 180° turn, 5 m return) and ECC-EXT (R = −0.674)
  and ECC-FLEX (R = −0.603). Moderate to large correlations were observed between
  approach velocity (AV) and COD performance (R = −0.484) and ECC-EXT (R = 0.724).
  Stronger participants (n = 9) recorded significantly (p textless 0.05) faster AV
  (4.01 ± 0.18 vs. 3.74 ± 0.24 m·s−1, d = 1.27) and a greater reduction in velocity
  (−1.55 ± 0.17 vs. −1.37 ± 0.21 m·s−1, d = −0.94) during penultimate contact than
  weaker (n = 9) subjects. Greater ECC-STR is associated with faster COD performance
  in female soccer players, as stronger players are better able to decelerate during
  penultimate contact from faster approach velocities.
