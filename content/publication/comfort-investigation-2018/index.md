abstract: "Comfort, P, Dos'Santos, T, Thomas, C, McMahon, JJ, and Suchomel, TJ. An\
  \ investigation into the effects of excluding the catch phase of the power clean\
  \ on force-time characteristics during isometric and dynamic tasks: an intervention\
  \ study. J Strength Cond Res 32(8): 2116–2129, 2018—The aims of this study were\
  \ to compare the effects of the exclusion or inclusion of the catch phase during\
  \ power clean (PC) derivatives on force-time characteristics during isometric and\
  \ dynamic tasks, after two 4-week mesocycles of resistance training. Two strength\
  \ matched groups completed the twice-weekly training sessions either including the\
  \ catch phase of the PC derivatives (Catch group: n = 16; age 19.3 ± 2.1 years;\
  \ height 1.79 ± 0.08 m; body mass 71.14 ± 11.79 kg; PC 1 repetition maximum [1RM]\
  \ 0.93 ± 0.15 kg·kg−1) or excluding the catch phase (Pull group: n = 18; age 19.8\
  \ ± 2.5 years; height 1.73 ± 0.10 m; body mass 66.43 ± 10.13 kg; PC 1RM 0.91 ± 0.18\
  \ kg·kg−1). The Catch and Pull groups both demonstrated significant (p ≤ 0.007,\
  \ power ≥0.834) and meaningful improvements in countermovement jump height (10.8\
  \ ± 12.3%, 5.2 ± 9.2%), isometric mid-thigh pull performance (force [F]100: 14.9\
  \ ± 17.2%, 15.5 ± 16.0%, F150: 16.0 ± 17.6%, 16.2 ± 18.4%, F200: 15.8 ± 17.6%, 17.9\
  \ ± 18.3%, F250: 10.0 ± 16.1%,10.9 ± 14.4%, peak force: 13.7 ± 18.7%, 9.7 ± 16.3%),\
  \ and PC 1RM (9.5 ± 6.2%, 8.4 ± 6.1%), before and after intervention, respectively.\
  \ In contrast to the hypotheses, there were no meaningful or significant differences\
  \ in the percentage change for any variables between groups. This study clearly\
  \ demonstrates that neither the inclusion nor exclusion of the catch phase of the\
  \ PC derivatives results in any preferential adaptations over two 4-week, in-season\
  \ strength and power, mesocycles."
