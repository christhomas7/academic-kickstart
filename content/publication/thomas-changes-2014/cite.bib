 abstract = {This study aimed to examine performance changes in lacrosse players during a 24-week competitive season (including 22 weeks of periodized resistance training (RT)). Eleven male lacrosse players (age 24.5 ± 4.3 years, height 180.4 ± 5.6 cm, body mass 80.5 ± 5.7 kg, 1 repetition maximum (1RM) back squat (BS) 113.3 ± 17.8 kg, 1RM power clean (PC) 67.2 ± 19.7 kg) participated in this study. Testing included 5-, 10-, 20-m sprints, change of direction (COD), countermovement jump (CMJ), and squat jump (SJ). Testing sessions occurred during week one (T-1), week six (T-2), week 15 (T-3), and week 24 (T-4) of a domestic season. Significant improvements in 20-m sprint performance occurred from T-1 to T-4 (3.04 ± 0.07 seconds, 2.98 ± 0.08 seconds, p = 0.018). Left leg COD tests significantly improved from T-1 to T-2 (3.20 ± 0.15 seconds, 3.10 ± 0.13 seconds, p = 0.005), and T-1 to T-4 (3.20 ± 0.15 seconds, 3.07 ± 0.12 seconds, p = 0.014). Right leg COD tests significantly improved from T-1 to T-4 (3.20 ± 0.15 seconds, 3.08 ± 0.12 seconds, p = 0.002), and T-3 to T-4 (3.20 ± 0.15 seconds, 3.08 ± 0.12 seconds, p = 0.001). SJ height significantly decrease from T-1 to T-2 (38.2 ± 2.63 centimeters, 36.7 ± 2.57 centimeters, p = 0.008). Results demonstrate that improvements in sprint and COD performance can occur during the season in male lacrosse players engaged in periodized RT, therefore coaches and strength and conditioning coaches should focus on development rather than maintenance in season.},
