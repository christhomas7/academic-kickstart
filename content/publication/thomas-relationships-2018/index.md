abstract: Previous studies have reported an association between global measures of
  bilateral strength and change of direction (COD) ability. Yet, little is known about
  the association between unilateral muscle strength qualities and COD ability. The
  aim of this study was to explore the associations between unilateral muscle strength
  qualities and COD measures (COD speed (CODS) and COD deficit) when matched limb-for-limb
  (i.e., right limb vs. right limb, left limb vs. left limb) in adolescent team-sport
  athletes. One hundred and fifteen athletes (56 males, 59 females) active in cricket,
  netball, and basketball participated in this investigation. Each player performed
  trials of countermovement jump (CMJ), single-leg hop (SLH), isometric mid-thigh
  pull (IMTP) and eccentric knee extensor torque (ECC-EXT) to assess muscle strength
  qualities and 505 and modified 505 (505mod) to evaluate COD ability. Moderate-to-large
  correlations were observed between SLH and CODS (r = −0.43 to −0.67). Another important
  finding was that CMJ measures demonstrated moderate-to-large correlations with CODS
  (r = −0.38 to −0.69) and small-to-moderate correlations with COD deficit (r = −0.24
  to −0.45). COD is underpinned by distinct muscle strength qualities and each contribute
  to specific phases of a COD task. It is therefore likely that such connections exist
  between muscle strength qualities and COD, with all qualities contributing to overall
  COD ability.
