abstract: 'Purpose: To determine the reliability of the Dynamic Strength Index (DSI)
  in college athletes. Method: Nineteen male college athletes performed the squat
  jump (SJ) and isometric midthigh pull (IMTP) to determine peak force, on 2 separate
  days. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical
  error (TE), percentage change in the mean, smallest worthwhile change (SWC), and
  coefficient of variation (%CV). Results: Peak force for the SJ was 2137±499 N and
  2781±435 N for the IMTP, resulting in a mean DSI of 0.78±0.19. Peak forces in the
  SJ (ICC=.99, TE=57.22 N, change in mean=0.2%, SWC=4.7%, CV=2.6%) and IMTP (ICC=.95,
  TE=104.22 N, change in mean=0.5%, SWC=3.1%, CV=3.8%) were considered highly reliable
  between sessions. However, IMTP peak force was the only variable with an overall
  TEtextlessSWC. The DSI was also highly reliable (ICC=.97, TE=0.03, change in mean=-0.3%,
  SWC=5.1%, CV=4.6%) between sessions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that peak
  force in the SJ and IMTP are reliable, resulting in a reliable assessment of dynamic-force-production
  capabilities via the DSI. The DSI may be used to guide individualized training interventions
  and monitor specific adaptations to training. Changes in SJ peak force, IMTP peak
  force, and DSI were textgreater4.67%, 3.13%, and 5.13%, respectively, identifying
  meaningful changes in response to training or competition.'
